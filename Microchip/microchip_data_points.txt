Microchip FY2025 Form 10-K (fiscal year ended March 31, 2025)
-------------------------------------------------------------
- Net sales $4.4016B (-42.3% YoY vs. FY2024 $7.6344B; FY2023 $8.4387B) as the inventory correction rippled across industrial and auto accounts; gross profit $2.468B (56.1% margin, -930 bps YoY) on $1.934B cost of sales, yielding operating income $296M (6.7% margin) and a small GAAP net loss of $0.5M (diluted EPS -$0.01; common dividend per share $1.816).
- Expense profile: R&D $983.8M (22.4% of sales, -10% YoY) on continued investment in mixed-signal MCU roadmaps; SG&A $617.7M (14.0% of sales, -16% YoY); amortization of acquired intangibles $490.9M (down $114M as accelerated methods roll off); special charges $79.2M tied to headcount and contract exits.
- Product mix: Mixed-signal microcontrollers $2.250B (51.1% of revenue, -47% YoY), Analog $1.157B (26.3%, -42.6% YoY), Other $0.995B (22.6%, -26% YoY including FPGA/IP/licensing). 64% of FY2025 sales shipped from external foundries and 67% of assembly/test volume stayed in-house.
- Geographic mix: Americas $1.326B (30.2% of sales), Europe $0.878B (19.9%), Asia $2.198B (49.9%); ~75% of revenue invoiced to foreign customers with distributor channel still at 45% of mix (Arrow 10% of total). Distributor inventory fell to 33 days (41 days prior year) while Microchip’s on-balance-sheet inventory held at $1.29B or 251 days (224 days FY2024) as fabs ran below normal capacity, triggering $132M of under-absorption charges.
- Cash flow & liquidity: Operating cash $898M (20% of sales) after $345M payables drawdown and $31.6M inventory release; capex $126M (paused most expansion, targeting <$100M in FY2026) and investments $165M drove $288M net investing outflow. Year-end cash $772M, current assets $2.99B vs. current liabilities $1.16B (2.6x ratio); inventory plus LTSA deposits remain the swing factors.
- Capital structure: Total debt $5.66B (long-term $5.38B) supported by $2.25B revolver and $2.25B commercial paper program (CP outstanding $175M year-end). Issued $1.45B of 7.5% Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock in March 2025; net leverage covenants temporarily eased to 5.5x while inventory correction plays out.
- Capital returns: FY2025 cash dividends $975.7M (quarterly $0.455/share exiting FY2025) plus $2.2M preferred dividends; buybacks slowed to $96.5M (1M shares) as liquidity preserved, leaving $1.56B still authorized.
- Strategic/operations: Paused the majority of factory expansion projects and closed Fab 2 (Tempe) by May 2025; pursuing $162M preliminary CHIPS Act grants for U.S. fabs but final award still pending. LTSA deposits are being refunded as customers meet reduced minimums, pressuring deferred revenue and cash receipts.
- Risk disclosures: IRS transfer-pricing disputes (FY2007-2016) plus Malaysia asset characterization case (up to $410M exposure) and German ORIP assessments (up to $92M) remain unresolved; management confident but warns of potential cash/tax impacts if authorities prevail.

Microchip Q2 FY2026 (quarter ended September 30, 2025)
------------------------------------------------------
- Quarterly net sales $1.140B (-2.0% YoY, +4% QoQ) with gross profit $638M (55.9% margin) and operating income $88.9M (7.8% margin vs. 12.6% prior year) as absorption drag and higher opex offset sequential revenue growth; GAAP net income $41.7M but after $27.8M preferred dividends, net income to common slipped to $13.9M (diluted EPS $0.03).
- Six-month FY2026 revenue $2.216B (-7.9% YoY) with operating income $121M (5.5% margin) and net loss to common $(32.5)M; R&D $517.8M (23% of sales) and SG&A $331.6M (15%) reflect ongoing investment despite cost controls.
- Cash flow (six months): Operating cash $363.7M aided by $201M inventory drawdown but offset by $179M tax payments and $75.8M other asset use; capex $54.4M keeps investing cash to $(98.9)M, while financing cash $(799.7)M reflects $650M CP repayment, $1.2B senior note maturity, $544M dividends (common + preferred), and absence of buybacks.
- Balance sheet at 9/30/25: Cash $236.8M (down $535M since March), net accounts receivable $746M, inventories $1.095B as LTSA-related customer pushouts continue. Total assets $14.47B vs. total liabilities $7.77B; long-term debt $5.376B, total equity $6.696B. Current ratio 2.25x and tangible liquidity tight until LTSA refunds and dividends normalize.
- Management commentary highlights: Sequential improvement in mixed-signal MCU and analog sales in September quarter with Americas and Asia up, Europe flat; ongoing recovery plan prioritizes inventory reduction, paused fab expansion, and targeted factory loadings while awaiting broader macro stabilization.
