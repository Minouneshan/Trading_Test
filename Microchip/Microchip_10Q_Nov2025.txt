MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of Microchip Technology Incorporated and its majority-owned and controlledsubsidiaries (the Company).  All signiﬁcant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the ﬁnancial statements andtables in these notes, except per share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to the rules and regulations of theSEC.  The information furnished herein reﬂects all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair statement of theresults for the interim periods reported. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been condensed oromitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations.  It is suggested that these condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidatedﬁnancial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended March 31, 2025.  The results of operations for thethree and six months ended September 30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the ﬁscal year ending March 31, 2026 or for any otherperiod.
Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Other Developments
Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09-Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which modiﬁes the rules on income tax disclosures toenhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures, particularly in the rate reconciliation table and disclosures about income taxes paid. Theamendments are intended to address investors’ requests for income tax disclosures that provide more information to help them better understand an entity’s exposure topotential changes in tax laws and the ensuing risks and opportunities and to assess income tax information that aﬀects cash ﬂow forecasts and capital allocation decisions. Theguidance also eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. ASU 2023-09 is eﬀective for theCompany for the ﬁscal period ending March 31, 2026. All entities should apply the guidance prospectively but have the option to apply it retrospectively. The new standard willresult in enhanced disclosures in the Company's ﬁnancial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03-Income Statement (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses requiring disaggregated disclosuresof certain expense captions into speciﬁed categories in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements. ASU 2024-03 is eﬀective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted with updates to be applied prospectively with theoption for retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the applicable disclosures.
Note 3. Geographic and Segment Information The Company's business is made up of two operating segments, semiconductor products and technology licensing. These segments represent management's view of thebusiness for which separate ﬁnancial information is available and evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), which is the Company’s Chief ExecutiveOﬃcer.
In the semiconductor products segment, the Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets mixed-signal microcontrollers, development tools and analog, interface,mixed-signal, timing, wired and wireless connectivity devices, and memory products. Under the leadership of the CODM, the Company is structured and organized aroundstandardized roles and responsibilities based on product groups and functional activities. The Company's product groups are responsible for product research, design anddevelopment. The Company's functional activities include sales, marketing, manufacturing, information technology, human resources, legal and ﬁnance. The Company's productgroups have similar products, production processes, types of customers and methods for distribution. In addition, the tools and technologies used in the design and manufactureof the Company's products are shared among the various product groups. The Company's product group leaders, under the direction of the CODM, deﬁne the product roadmapsand team with sales personnel to achieve design wins and revenue and other performance targets. Product group leaders also interact with manufacturing and
10
Table of Contents
operational personnel who are responsible for the production, prioritization and planning of the Company's manufacturing capabilities to help ensure the eﬃciency of theCompany's operations and fulﬁllment of customer requirements.
The technology licensing segment includes sales and licensing of the Company's intellectual property.
The CODM uses segment gross proﬁt for evaluating each segment's performance and allocating resources. The Company does not allocate operating expenses, interestincome, interest expense, other income or expense, or provision for or beneﬁt from income taxes to these segments for internal reporting purposes, as the Company does notbelieve that allocating these expenses is beneﬁcial in evaluating segment performance.  Additionally, the Company does not allocate assets to segments for internal reportingpurposes as it does not manage its segments by such metrics.
The information that is regularly provided to the Company's CODM includes net sales, cost of sales and gross proﬁt for each segment. The following tables include net sales,cost of sales and gross proﬁt for each segment (in millions):

above are included in the Company's semiconductor product segment with the exception of licensees, which is included in the technology licensing segment. All of the Company'snet sales are recognized from contracts with customers.
The consideration received from customers is ﬁxed, with the exception of consideration from certain distributors and customers under LTSAs. Certain of the Company'sdistributors are granted price concessions and return rights, which result in variable consideration. The amount of revenue recognized for sales to these certain distributors isadjusted for estimates of the price concessions and return rights that are expected to be claimed. These estimates are based on the recent history of price concessions and stockrotations, which are recorded as refund liabilities within accrued liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company collects amounts in advance for certain of its contracts with customers. These amounts are deferred until control of the product or service is transferred to thecustomer at which time it is recognized as revenue. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $385.8 million of deferred revenue, of which $160.0 million isincluded within accrued liabilities and the remaining $225.8 million is included within other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. As ofMarch 31, 2025, the Company had approximately $597.9 million of deferred revenue, of which $213.4 million is included within accrued liabilities and the remaining$384.5 million is included within other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue represents amounts that have beeninvoiced in advance which are expected to be recognized as revenue in future periods. Approximately $98.6 million of deferred revenue recorded on the Company's consolidatedbalance sheets as of March 31, 2025 was recognized as revenue during the six months ended September 30, 2025. Approximately $129.9 million of deferred revenue recorded onthe Company's consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024 was recognized as revenue during the six months ended September 30, 2024.
Of the $385.8 million of deferred revenue as of September 30, 2025, $291.5 million is cash collected from customers under LTSAs, of which $88.8 million is included withinaccrued liabilities and $202.7 million is included within other long-term liabilities. Under these LTSAs, the Company receives an upfront deposit from the customer in exchange forassured supply over the contract period, which typically ranges from three years to ﬁve years. If the customer does not meet the minimum purchase commitments deﬁned in thecontract, the Company may retain all, or portions of, the deposit as revenue. If the Company fails to assure supply as deﬁned in the contract, the deposit, or portions of it, will bereturned to the customer. The remaining $94.3 million of deferred revenue as of September 30, 2025 is related to other cash payments received from customers in advance of theCompany’s performance obligations being satisﬁed. Most of the $94.3 million will be recognized as net sales within the next 12 months. The amount of other ﬁrmly committedorders with performance obligations in excess of 12 months at the time of order is immaterial.

The Company computed net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by reducing net income by the dividends on Series A Preferred Stock accumulated during theperiod. The Company computed basic net income (loss) per common share based on the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders divided by the basic weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company computed diluted net income (loss) per common share based on the net income (loss)attributable to common stockholders divided by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding duringthe period.
Potentially dilutive common shares from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs.Potentially dilutive common shares from the Series A Preferred Stock are determined by applying the if-converted method on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. Prior toconversion of its Convertible Debt, the Company will include, in the diluted net income per common share calculation, the eﬀect of the additional shares that may be issued whenthe Company's common stock price exceeds the conversion price using the if-converted method. The Company's Convertible Debt has no impact on diluted net income percommon share unless the average price of the Company's common stock exceeds the conversion price because the Company is required to settle the principal amount of theConvertible Debt in cash upon conversion. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the calculation of diluted net income per common share excluded 23.8 millioncommon shares issuable upon the exchange of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock as the related impact would have been anti-dilutive. For the six months endedSeptember 30, 2025, the calculation of diluted net loss per common share excluded 3.8 million common shares from employee equity incentive plans, 0.4 million common sharesissuable upon the exchange of the Company's 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, and 25.4 million common shares issuable upon the exchange of the Company's Series A PreferredStock as the related impact would have been anti-dilutive.
The following is the weighted average conversion price per share used in calculating the dilutive eﬀect (see Note 6 for details on the Convertible Debt):
Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30,
2025 2024 2025 2024
2015 Senior Convertible Debt $ — $ 28.50 $ — $ 28.58 2017 Senior Convertible Debt $ 43.17 $ 44.44 $ 43.32 $ 44.57 2020 Senior Convertible Debt $ — $ 90.93 $ — $ 91.08 
2024 Senior Convertible Debt $ 121.81 $ 121.84 $ 121.82 $ 121.84 
The weighted average conversion price per share for the 2015 Senior Convertible Debt was prior to the settlement of the outstanding principal amount in February 2025.The weighted average conversion price per share for the 2020 Senior Convertible Debt was prior to the settlement of the outstanding principal amount in November 2024.

Ranking of Convertible Debt - Each series of Convertible Debt is an unsecured obligation which is subordinated in right of payment to the amounts outstanding under theCompany's Senior Indebtedness. The Convertible Debt is subordinated to the Senior Indebtedness; ranks senior to the Company's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated inright of payment to it; ranks equal in right of payment to any of the Company's unsubordinated indebtedness that does not provide that it is senior to the Convertible Debt; ranksjunior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured and unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; andis structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.
Summary of Conversion Features - Each series of Convertible Debt is convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash, shares of the Company's common stock or acombination thereof, at the Company's election, at speciﬁed conversion rates (see table below), adjusted for certain events including the declaration of cash dividends. Exceptduring the three-month period immediately preceding the maturity date of the applicable series of Convertible Debt, each series of Convertible Debt is convertible only upon theoccurrence of (i) such time as the closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds the applicable conversion price (see table below) by 130% for 20 trading days (whether ornot consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding ﬁscal quarter, (ii) during the 5 business day periodafter any 10 consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes of a given series for each trading day ofthe measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such tradingday, or (iii) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events speciﬁed in the indenture of such series of Convertible Debt. In addition, for each series, with the exception of the2024 Senior Convertible Debt, if at the time of conversion the applicable price of the Company's common stock exceeds the applicable conversion price at such time, theapplicable conversion rate will be increased by up to an additional maximum incremental shares rate, as determined pursuant to a formula speciﬁed in the indenture for theapplicable series of Convertible Debt, and as adjusted for cash dividends paid since the issuance of such series of Convertible Debt. However, in no event will the applicableconversion rate exceed the applicable maximum conversion rate speciﬁed in the indenture for the applicable series of Convertible Debt (see table below).
The following table sets forth the applicable conversion rates adjusted for dividends declared since issuance of such series of Convertible Debt and the applicable incrementalshare factors and maximum conversion rates as adjusted for dividends paid since the applicable issuance date:
Dividend adjusted rates as of September 30, 2025
Conversion Rate Approximate ConversionPrice Incremental Share Factor Maximum Conversion Rate
2017 Senior Convertible Debt 23.1616 $ 43.17 11.5817 33.0053 2024 Senior Convertible Debt 8.2094 $ 121.81 — 10.4669 
As of September 30, 2025, the 2024 Senior Convertible Debt was not convertible. As of September 30, 2025, the holders of the 2017 Senior Convertible Debt have the rightto convert their notes between October 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025 because the Company's common stock price has exceeded the applicable conversion price for suchseries by 130% for the speciﬁed period of time during the quarter ended September 30, 2025.
With the exception of the 2024 Senior Convertible Debt, which may be redeemed by the Company on or after June 5, 2027, the Company may not redeem any series ofConvertible Debt prior to the relevant maturity date and no sinking fund is

provided for any series of Convertible Debt. Under the terms of the applicable indenture, the Company may repurchase any series of Convertible Debt in the open market orthrough privately negotiated exchange oﬀers. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as deﬁned in the applicable indenture of such series of Convertible Debt, holders ofsuch series may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Convertible Debt for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaidinterest. Additionally, holders of the 2024 Senior Convertible Debt may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 2024 Senior Convertible Debt for cash at a priceequal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest if, prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2027, the lastreported sale price of our common stock is less than the applicable conversion price of the 2024 Senior Convertible Debt.

Commercial Paper
In September 2023, the Company established a Commercial Paper program under which the Company may issue short-term unsecured promissory notes up to a maximumprincipal amount outstanding at any time of $2.75 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The Company's obligations with respect to the payment of theCommercial Paper are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries. The Commercial Paper will be sold at a discount from par or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest ratesthat will vary based on market conditions and the time of issuance. The Company's intention is to reduce the amounts that would otherwise be available to borrow under theCompany's Revolving Credit Facility by the outstanding amount of Commercial Paper. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had $1.12 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding.The weighted-average interest rate of the Company's outstanding Commercial Paper was 4.47% as of September 30, 2025. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, as amended andrestated in March 2025, the maximum principal amount outstanding at any time under the Commercial Paper program is $2.25 billion.
Note 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  As a basisfor considering such assumptions, the Company utilizes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1- Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
(1)

Table of Contents
Level 2- Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; andLevel 3- Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, which include money market funds, approximates fair value because their maturity is less than three months. The amount of cashand cash equivalents held by the Company in the form of money-market funds as of March 31, 2025 was $491.1 million. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accountspayable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the amounts and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  
The fair value of the Company's Commercial Paper is estimated using discounted cash ﬂow analysis, based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similartypes of borrowing arrangements. The fair value of the Company's Commercial Paper approximates the carrying value excluding debt discounts and debt issuance costs and areconsidered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company measures the fair value of its Convertible Debt and Senior Notes for disclosure purposes. These fair values are basedon observable market prices for this debt, which is traded in less active markets and are therefore classiﬁed as a Level 2 fair value measurement.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's debt obligations (in millions):

Indemniﬁcation Contingencies
The Company's technology license agreements generally include an indemniﬁcation clause that indemniﬁes the licensee against liability and damages (including legal defensecosts) arising from any claims of patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret infringement by the Company's proprietary technology.  The terms of these indemniﬁcationprovisions approximate the terms of the outgoing technology license agreements, which are typically perpetual unless terminated by either party for breach. The possible amountof future payments the Company could be required to make based on agreements that specify indemniﬁcation limits, if such indemniﬁcations were required on all of theseagreements, is approximately $197.0 million. There are some licensing agreements in place that do not specify indemniﬁcation limits. As of September 30, 2025, the Company hadnot recorded any liabilities related to these indemniﬁcation obligations and the Company believes that any amounts that it may be required to pay under these agreements in thefuture will not have a material adverse eﬀect on its ﬁnancial position, cash ﬂows or results of operations.
Warranty Costs and Product Liabilities
The Company accrues for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no materialaccruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, the Company has experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although the Companycannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, the Company does not believe these claims will have a material adverse eﬀect on its ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations or liquidity.
Legal Matters
In the ordinary course of the Company's business, it is exposed to various legal actions as a result of contracts, product liability, customer claims, pricing or royalty disputeswith customers and licensees, governmental investigations and other matters. The Company is involved in a limited number of these legal actions, both as plaintiﬀ and defendant,with respect to the foregoing types of matters. Consequently, the Company could incur uninsured liability in any of these legal actions.  The Company also periodically receivesnotiﬁcations from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs. Withrespect to pending legal actions to which the Company is a party and other claims, although the outcomes are generally not determinable, the Company believes that the ultimateresolution of these matters (other than certain tax matters in the U.S., Germany, and Malaysia as described in Note 11 below) will not have a material adverse eﬀect on itsﬁnancial position, cash ﬂows or results of operations. Litigation, governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon, and theCompany is, from time to time, subject to such litigation, governmental investigations and disputes.  As a result, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcomeof any such litigation, governmental investigations or disputes in the future.
The Company accrues for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, the Companyreviews each of its matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, the Company accrues for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where theCompany can reasonably estimate a range of losses it may incur regarding such a matter, the Company records an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes its bestestimate. If the Company can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, the Company uses the amount that isthe low end of such range. As of September 30, 2025, the Company's estimate of the aggregate potential liability for legal matters that is possible but not probable isapproximately $25.0 million in excess of amounts accrued.

Note 11. Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740. The provision for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. TheCompany’s tax beneﬁt for the six months ended September 30, 2025 resulted in a negative eﬀective tax rate of 44.4% and is based on an estimated annual eﬀective tax rateincluding the tax eﬀect of items required to be recorded discretely in the interim periods in which those items occur. A comparison of the Company’s eﬀective tax rates for the sixmonths ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 is not meaningful due to changes in the amount of pre-tax income earned, changes in the mix of jurisdictions inwhich income is earned, and the impact of discrete items relative to the amount of income earned.
The Company's eﬀective tax rate is diﬀerent than the statutory rates in the U.S. due to foreign income taxed at diﬀerent rates than the U.S., changes in uncertain tax beneﬁtpositions, changes to valuation allowances, generation of tax credits, and the impact of Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) in the U.S. In addition, the Company hasnumerous tax holidays it receives related to its Thailand manufacturing operations based on its investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand. The Company's taxholiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future, however, the Company actively seeks to obtain new tax holidays. The material components of foreign incometaxed at a rate lower than the U.S. are earnings accrued in Thailand, Malta, and Ireland.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company's gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts for the six months ended September 30, 2025 and the year endedMarch 31, 2025 (in millions): 
September 30, March 31,2025 2025
Beginning gross unrecognized tax beneﬁt $ 821.2 $ 792.4 
Decreases related to settlements with tax authorities (50.4) (0.7)Decreases related to statute of limitation expirations (5.1) (6.9)Increases related to current year tax positions 8.8 27.1 
Increases (decreases) related to prior year tax positions (83.2) 9.3 
Ending gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts $ 691.3 $ 821.2 
 As of September 30, 2025 and March 31, 2025, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to tax contingencies of $103.2 million and $135.8 million,respectively, included within long-term income tax payable on the consolidated balance sheets. During the six months ended September 30, 2025, the Company releasedpreviously accrued interest and penalties of $32.6 million, compared to the charges in interest and penalties to operations of $31.2 million in the ﬁscal year ended March 31,2025.
The Company is currently under income tax examination in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The years under examination range from ﬁscal 2007 through ﬁscal2024. In some jurisdictions, the Company has received tax assessments in excess of established reserves. The Company is contesting these tax assessments, and will continue todo so, including pursuing all available remedies such as appeals and litigation, if necessary. During ﬁscal 2026, additional assessments were received for these issues and theCompany’s position remains unchanged.
The total amount of gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $691.3 million and $821.2 million as of September 30, 2025, and March 31, 2025, respectively, of which $613.5million and $706.4 million is estimated to impact the Company's eﬀective tax rate, if recognized. Unrecognized tax beneﬁts may change in the next 12 months due to expiration ofstatutes of limitation, changes in the Company’s judgment about the level of uncertainty arising from new information, status of tax examinations, tax litigation, and legislativechanges. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the change in the unrecognized tax beneﬁts in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include various U.S.and non-U.S. matters.
The Company reviews its unrecognized tax positions at each interim period. In the quarter ending September 30, 2025, due to settlements reached with tax authorities, theCompany determined that certain unrecognized tax positions should be remeasured, including the indirect tax eﬀects, penalties, and interest associated with these unrecognizedtax positions. The eﬀect of this change in estimate was to record an income tax beneﬁt of $24.4 million, which increased basic net income per common share by $0.05 for each ofthe three and six months ended September 30, 2025, and increased diluted net income per common share by $0.04 and $0.05 for the three and six months ended September 30,2025, respectively, and which are a component of income tax provision from continuing operations.

The Company ﬁles U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign income tax returns.  For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, the ﬁscal 2007 and later tax years remainopen for examination by tax authorities.  For foreign tax returns, the Company is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to ﬁscal 2007.
In September 2021, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deﬁciency (2007 to 2012 Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for ﬁscal 2007through ﬁscal 2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2021, the Company ﬁled a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2007 to2012 Notice. In September 2023, the Company received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for ﬁscal 2013 and ﬁscal 2016. In October 2023, the Company received aStatutory Notice of Deﬁciency (2014 to 2015 Notice) from the IRS for ﬁscal 2014 and ﬁscal 2015. The disputed amounts for ﬁscal 2013 to ﬁscal 2016 largely relate to transferpricing matters. In December 2023, the Company ﬁled a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2014 to 2015 Notice. In September 2025, the Company reached a settlementwith the IRS for ﬁscal years 2007 through 2015.
In May 2023, the Company received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for ﬁscal 2020. In December 2023, the Company receiveda Notice of Assessment from the IRB asserting the same proposed income adjustment. In March 2025, the Company entered into a Consent Judgment before the High Court,agreeing that the dispute will be heard before the Special Commissioners of Income Tax (SCIT). It was also agreed that the payment on the taxes assessed is stayed and the IRB willpause all enforcement and proceedings against the collection of the taxes assessed until the appeal before the SCIT is concluded. If the adjustment is upheld by the highest courtthat has jurisdiction over this matter in Malaysia, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $410.0 million. The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization ofcertain assets. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could commence in the next 12 months.
In January 2025, the Company received several assessments from the German Tax Authorities (GTA) regarding the German extraterritorial taxation of royalty paymentsbetween nonresidents (referred to as oﬀshore receipts in respect of intangible property or ORIP) and intellectual property transfers by nonresidents (referred to as extraterritorialcapital gains taxation or ETT). If the assessment is upheld, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $92.0 million. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain butcould occur in the next 12 months.
The Company ﬁrmly believes that the IRB and GTA assessments are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolvethese matters. The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions and the Company is conﬁdent in its ability to prevail on the merits. The Company regularly assesses thelikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as these to determine the adequacy of the Company's tax reserves. The ultimate outcome of disputes of thisnature is uncertain, and if the IRB or GTA were to prevail on their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deﬁciency interest could have a material adverse impact on theCompany's ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.

Preferred Stock was declared on November 6, 2025 and will be paid on December 15, 2025 to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock of record as of December 1, 2025.
The following table provides the conversion rate per share of our Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments:
Applicable Market Value of Common Stock Conversion Rate per share of Series A Preferred Stock
Greater than $62.4766 16.0060 shares of common stock
Equal to or less than $62.4766 but greater than or equal to $50.9996 Between 16.0060 and 19.6080 shares of common stock, determined by dividing $1,000 by theapplicable market valueLess than $50.9996 19.6080 shares of common stock
Unless earlier converted, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert on March 15, 2028, into between 16.0060 shares and 19.6080 shares of theCompany's common stock, depending on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments described in the certiﬁcate ofdesignations governing the Series A Preferred Stock (Certiﬁcate of Designations). The applicable market value of the Company's common stock will be determined based on theaverage volume-weighted average price per share of the common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading dayimmediately prior to March 15, 2028.
If a fundamental change, as deﬁned in the Certiﬁcate of Designations, occurs on or prior to March 15, 2028, then holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled toconvert all or any portion of their shares into shares of the Company's common stock at the fundamental change conversion rate, as deﬁned in the Certiﬁcate of Designations, fora speciﬁed period of time and also to receive an amount to compensate such holders for unpaid accumulated dividends and any remaining future scheduled dividend payments.Other than during a fundamental change conversion period, at any time prior to March 15, 2028, holders of Series A Preferred Stock may elect to convert all or any portion of theirshares at a conversion rate of 16.0060 shares of common stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments as described in theCertiﬁcate of Designations.
In connection with the issuance of the 29.7 million Depositary Shares, representing approximately 1.5 million shares of its Series A Preferred Stock, the Company entered intocapped call option transactions with several ﬁnancial institutions at a cost of $55.1 million. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company may exercise the cappedcall options subject to a cap price of $71.40 per share, subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call options, which are generally expected to reduce thepotential dilution to the Company's common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and/or oﬀset any cash payments the Company is required to make. As thesetransactions meet certain accounting criteria, the capped call options are recorded as a reduction of stockholders' equity and are not accounted for as derivatives.
Common Stock Dividends

Introduction
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.
We begin our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with a summary of business and macroeconomic developmentsfollowed by a summary of our overall business strategy to provide an overview of the goals and overall direction of our business. This is followed by a discussion of the CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported ﬁnancial results. We then discussour Results of Operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an analysis ofchanges in our balance sheet and cash ﬂows, and discuss our ﬁnancial commitments in the section titled "Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Business and Macroeconomic Environment
During most of ﬁscal 2025, our overall business was weak as we navigated through a large inventory correction. However, in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2026, we saw a signiﬁcant
improvement in our overall business compared to the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2025. Net sales in our mixed-signal microcontroller and analog product lines increased sequentiallyin the September 2025 quarter compared to the June 2025 quarter. Net sales were up sequentially in Americas and Asia and ﬂat in Europe in the September 2025 quartercompared to the June 2025 quarter. Consistent with the business recovery plan which we implemented in March 2025, we continued to reduce inventory in the September 2025quarter compared to the June 2025 quarter. Most of our factory expansion activity remains paused as we continue to execute our recovery plan and take actions to further reduceinventory.
Strategy We develop, manufacture and sell smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions used by our customers for a wide variety of applications. Our strategic focusincludes general purpose and specialized 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit mixed-signal microcontrollers, microprocessors, analog, FPGA, and memory products. With over 30 years oftechnology leadership, our broad product portfolio is a Total System Solution (TSS) for our customers that can provide a large portion of the silicon requirements in theirapplications. TSS is a combination of hardware, software and services which help our customers increase their revenue, reduce their costs and manage their risks compared toother solutions. Our synergistic product portfolio empowers disruptive growth trends, including AI/ML, data centers, edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT), E-mobility,networking and connectivity, and sustainability, in key end markets such as automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, consumer appliances, data centers andcomputing, and industrial.
Our manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test. Due to high inventory levels and ample capacity, on December 2, 2024, weannounced our decision to close our Tempe, Arizona wafer fabrication facility that we refer to as Fab 2 and the closure of Fab 2 was completed in May 2025. We entered into anagreement to sell Fab 2 to a third party in October 2025, and we expect the sale of the Fab 2 facility to be completed in December 2025. Many of the process technologies that ranin Fab 2 also run in our Oregon and Colorado factories, which both have ample clean room space for expansion, and we are transferring production of many devices from Fab 2 toour Oregon and Colorado locations. The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us tomaintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry.  By owning wafer fabrication facilities andour assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (statistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able toachieve and maintain high production yields.  Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles and capture a portion of thewafer manufacturing and assembly and testing proﬁt margin.
We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products.  We believe our processes aﬀord us both cost-eﬀective designs inexisting and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs.  While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic andmemory product lines, we use a common process technology for both mixed-signal microcontroller and non-volatile memory products.  This allows us to more fully leverage ourprocess research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly.  Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design tools and software toperform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafersquickly and eﬃciently.

We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing processtechnologies.  We believe these investments are signiﬁcant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  Our current research and development activities focus on the designof new mixed-signal microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, FPGAs, timing systems, Flash-IP, development systems, software andapplication-speciﬁc software libraries.  We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in ourproducts. 
We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors. Our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategicaccounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia.  We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all threegeographic markets. We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market.  Many of our CEMs, FAEs,and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments.  We believe that the technical and businessknowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products.  The primary mission of our FAEs team is to provide technical assistance to customers andto conduct periodic training sessions for our sales team.  FAEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through onlinewebcasts. Our licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees. See the risk factor captioned "Our operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide ﬂuctuations of supply and demand in the industry" on page 48 for discussion ofthe impact of seasonality on our business.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the ﬁrst six months of the ﬁscal year ending March 31, 2026 compared to our "CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates" as previously described in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended March 31, 2025.

Net Sales We operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of ourSuperFlash and other technologies.  We sell our products to distributors and OEMs in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generallyrequire no collateral.  In certain circumstances, a customer's ﬁnancial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided in the form ofletters of credit.

The decreases in net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due tomany customers having high levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders and, to a lesser extent, adverse economic conditions, including slow economic activity, businessuncertainty, persistent inﬂation and high interest rates. Due to the size, complexity and diversity of our customer base, we are not able to quantify any material factor contributingto the changes in net sales. See our "Business and Macroeconomic Environment" discussion above for further information on our business outlook.
Other factors that we believe contributed to the changes in our reported net sales for the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three and sixmonths ended September 30, 2024 and which are drivers of long-term trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include:
• economic and competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry;• our various new product oﬀerings that have increased our served available market;• intense competition in our key markets;• customers’ needs for the ﬂexibility oﬀered by our programmable solutions;• increasing semiconductor content in our customers’ products; and• geopolitical conditions, tariﬀs and other trade restrictions.
We sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of thechanges in our net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 or the three and six months ended September 30, 2024.
Net sales by product line for the periods covered by this report were as follows (dollars in millions):

Mixed-signal Microcontrollers Our mixed-signal microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales.  Mixed-signal microcontrollers and associated application developmentsystems accounted for approximately 51.3% and 50.4% of our net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to approximately 51.1%and 51.5% of our net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales of our mixed-signal microcontroller products decreased 1.7% and 9.9% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the threeand six months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases in net sales were primarily due to many customers having high levels of inventory and delaying or reducing ordersand, to a lesser extent, adverse economic conditions, including slow economic activity, business uncertainty, persistent inﬂation and high interest rates.
Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. However, the overall average selling prices of our mixed-signal microcontroller products have remained relatively stable in recent periods due to the proprietary nature of these products.  We have in the past been able to moderateaverage selling price declines in our mixed-signal microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices.  
Analog Our analog product line includes analog, interface, mixed-signal and timing products. Our analog product line accounted for approximately 28.2% and 28.8% of our net salesin the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to approximately 25.1% and 25.9% of our net sales in the three and six months ended September30, 2024, respectively.

Net sales from our analog product line increased 10.1% and 2.4% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the three and six monthsended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a portion of our customer base having worked through their previous high inventory balances and needing to purchase products at ahigher level to support demand. We consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced inour mixed-signal microcontroller products. The non-proprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price ﬂuctuations, driven primarily by the current supply anddemand for those products.
Other Our other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, feesfor engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application speciﬁc integratedcircuits, and certain products for aerospace applications. Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 20.5% and 20.8% of our net sales in the threeand six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to approximately 23.8% and 22.6% of our net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024,respectively.
Net sales related to these services and products decreased 15.4% and 15.1% in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the three andsix months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases in net sales were primarily due to many customers having high levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders and, toa lesser extent, adverse economic conditions, including slow economic activity, business uncertainty, persistent inﬂation and high interest rates. Net sales of our other product linecan ﬂuctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our FPGA products, licenses, engineering services,memory products, timing systems, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).  Distribution Distributors accounted for approximately 45% and 46% of our net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and approximately 44% and 45%of our net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which accounted for 11%and 10% of our net sales in the six months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively, no other distributor or direct customer accounted for more than 10%of our net sales during these periods. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributorsprovide an eﬀective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base and that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as aneﬀective supply channel.
Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advancenotice.  The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase ininventory returns. At September 30, 2025, our distributors maintained 27 days of inventory of our products compared to 33 days at March 31, 2025.  Over the past ten ﬁscal years, the days ofinventory maintained by our distributors have ﬂuctuated between approximately 17 days and 43 days.  Inventory holding patterns at our distributors have had a material adverseimpact on our net sales in recent periods. For example, when our distributors hold relatively high levels of inventory, they are likely to purchase fewer products from us.

Americas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America. Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75% and 76% ofour total net sales in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to approximately 74% and 75% of our total net sales in the three and sixmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Net sales decreased in all geographies in the six months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the six months endedSeptember 30, 2024, primarily due to many customers having high levels of inventory and delaying or reducing orders and, to a lesser extent, adverse economic conditions,including slow economic activity, business uncertainty, persistent inﬂation and high interest rates. Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated. Our sales forcein the Americas and Europe supports a signiﬁcant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia.
 Gross Proﬁt Our gross proﬁt in the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $637.9 million, or 55.9% of net sales, compared to $668.5 million, or 57.4% of net sales, in the threemonths ended September 30, 2024. Our gross proﬁt in the six months ended September 30, 2025 was $1.21 billion, or 54.8% of net sales, compared to $1.41 billion, or 58.4% ofnet sales, in the six months ended September 30, 2024.
The primary reasons for the decreases in gross proﬁt of $17.4 million and $173.9 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared tothe three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were an unfavorable net impact of sales volume, product mix, and geographic mix in the three and six monthsended September 30, 2025. The net impact of product mix may ﬂuctuate over time due to the mix of sales volumes of lower or higher margin products, changes in selling prices,and ﬂuctuations in product costs. We are not able to separately quantify these impacts on our gross proﬁt. The impact of unabsorbed capacity charges was an adverse impact of$11.0 million and $26.6 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September 30, 2024,respectively. Unabsorbed capacity charges are expensed as incurred when we operate our manufacturing facilities below normal levels. The net impact to our gross proﬁt frominventory reserve charges was a favorable impact of $4.1 million and $5.1 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the three andsix months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The gross margin impact of changes in licensing revenue, which has no associated cost of sales, was an unfavorable impact of$6.4 million and a favorable impact of $4.5 million in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended September30, 2024, respectively.
Our overall inventory levels were $1.10 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $1.29 billion at March 31, 2025. We maintained 199 days of inventory on our balancesheet at September 30, 2025 compared to 251 days of inventory at March 31, 2025. Our overall inventory level in dollars and days decreased as a result of our eﬀorts to balancemanufacturing production, customer demand and inventory levels. Our inventory amounts are impacted by timing of shipment activity in the quarter, the timing of receipt of rawmaterials, foundry wafers, and strategic last time buy materials and completion of ﬁnished goods. We believe that our current inventory and production capacity are adequate tofulﬁll the projected requirements of our customers and our levels of inventory will continue to be lower over the next several quarters based on the actions we have taken. We operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand and the Philippines. Approximately 66% and 68% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assemblyfacilities during the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, compared to approximately 63% and 67% during the three and six months ended September30, 2024, respectively. Approximately 70% and 69% of our test requirements were performed in our internal facilities during the three and six months ended September 30, 2025,respectively, compared to approximately 64% and 67% during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The percentage of our assembly and testoperations that are performed

Table of Contents
internally ﬂuctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities. We believethat the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with signiﬁcant cost savings compared to third-party contractor assembly and test costs, aswell as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process. In addition, we have specialized assembly and test facilities dedicated to our aerospace and defenseproducts in Germany, France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States. These facilities are designed to support the unique requirements ofthese sectors, helping to accelerate time to market and ensure consistent, high-quality products. We plan to continue to selectively invest in assembly and test equipment toincrease our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.
We rely on outside wafer foundries for a signiﬁcant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. Approximately 66% and 65% of our net sales came from products that wereproduced at outside wafer foundries during each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024. This percentage may vary based on supply anddemand conditions in the market.
We anticipate that our gross margins will ﬂuctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall mix of products sold during the period, as well asmanufacturing yields, unabsorbed capacity charges, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve. We continue to transition products to more advancedprocess technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.
Research and Development
R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $262.3 million, or 23.0% of net sales, compared to $240.7 million, or 20.7% of net sales, for the threemonths ended September 30, 2024. R&D expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2025 were $517.8 million, or 23.4% of net sales, compared to $482.4 million, or 20.1%of net sales, for the six months ended September 30, 2024. We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in ourdesign and manufacturing process technologies.  We believe these investments are signiﬁcant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  R&D costs are expensed asincurred.  Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility orthat have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives.  R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for thedevelopment of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.
R&D expenses increased $21.6 million, or 9.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 over the same period last year.  R&D expenses increased $35.4 million, or7.3%, for the six months ended September 30, 2025 over the same period last year. The primary reasons for the increases in R&D expenses was higher employee compensationcosts, including higher share-based compensation partially oﬀset by our restructuring eﬀorts.
R&D expenses ﬂuctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 were $172.3 million, or 15.1% of net sales, compared to $157.0 million, or13.5% of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2025 were $331.6million, or 15.0% of net sales, compared to $307.5 million, or 12.8% of net sales, for the six months ended September 30, 2024.  Our goal is to continue to be more eﬃcient withour selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to ﬁeld sales, marketing and administrativepersonnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and FAEs who work to stimulate demand fromsales oﬃces worldwide by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15.3 million, or 9.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 over the same period last year.  Selling,general and administrative expenses increased $24.1 million, or 7.8%, for the six months ended September 30, 2025 over the same period last year.  The primary reasons for theincreases in selling, general and administrative expenses was higher acquisition related and employee compensation costs, including higher share-based compensation partiallyoﬀset by our restructuring eﬀorts.
Selling, general and administrative expenses ﬂuctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 was $108.1 million and $215.7 million, respectively, compared to $122.7million and $245.7 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The primary reason for the decreases in acquired intangible asset amortizationwas due to the use of accelerated amortization methods for assets placed in service in previous ﬁscal years.
Special Charges and Other, Net
During the three and six months ended September 30, 2025, we incurred special charges and other, net of $6.3 million and $28.5 million, respectively, primarily related torestructuring expenses, including contract exit costs, closure of our Tempe, Arizona wafer fabrication facility and employee separation costs. During the three and six monthsended September 30, 2024, we incurred special charges and other, net of $1.5 million and $4.1 million, respectively, primarily related to the restructuring of existing waferfabrication operations to increase operational eﬃciency.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest income in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 was $3.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively, compared to $2.0 million and $4.8 million,respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024.
Interest expense in the three and six months ended September 30, 2025 was $56.3 million and $113.7 million, respectively, compared to $59.1 million and $120.9 million,respectively, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. The primary reason for the decreases in interest expense were lower debt balances in the three and sixmonths ended September 30, 2025.
Other loss, net in the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $4.4 million compared to other income, net of $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30,2024. Other income, net in the six months ended September 30, 2025 was $0.2 million compared to other income, net of $3.7 million for the six months ended September 30,2024. The primary reason for the changes in other loss, net and other income, net in these periods relates to foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. A comparison of our eﬀective tax rate for the six months ended September 30,2025 and September 30, 2024 is not meaningful due to changes in the amount of pre-tax income earned, changes in the mix of jurisdictions in which income is earned, and theimpact of discrete items relative to the amount of income earned.
We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations. The eﬀective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generallylower than our combined U.S. federal and state eﬀective tax rate. Our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of the six months ended September 30, 2025 and September30, 2024 was approximately 22%. The diﬀerence in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, ﬁnancingarrangements and other factors. Our eﬀective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.
Our foreign tax rate diﬀerential primarily relates to our operations in Malta taxed at a 35.0% statutory tax rate and Ireland taxed at a 12.5% statutory tax rate. Additionally, ourThailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant, and equipment in Thailand. Our taxholiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rateof 20.0%. We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our eﬀective tax rate.
In September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deﬁciency (2007 to 2012 Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for ﬁscal 2007 through ﬁscal2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2021, we ﬁled a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2007 to 2012 Notice. InSeptember 2023, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for ﬁscal 2013 and ﬁscal 2016. In October 2023, we received a Statutory Notice of Deﬁciency (2014 to2015 Notice) from the IRS for ﬁscal 2014 and ﬁscal 2015. The disputed amounts for ﬁscal 2013

Table of Contents
to ﬁscal 2016 largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2023, we ﬁled a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2014 to 2015 Notice. In September 2025, wereached a settlement with the IRS for ﬁscal 2007 through ﬁscal 2015.
In May 2023, we received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for ﬁscal 2020. In December 2023, we received a Notice ofAssessment from the IRB asserting the same proposed income adjustment. In March 2025, we entered into a Consent Judgment before the High Court, agreeing that the disputewill be heard before the Special Commissioners of Income Tax (SCIT). It was also agreed that the payment on the taxes assessed is stayed and the IRB will pause all enforcementand proceedings against the collection of the taxes assessed until the appeal before the SCIT is concluded. If the adjustment is upheld by the highest court that has jurisdictionover this matter in Malaysia, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $410.0 million. The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization of certain assets. Thetiming of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could occur in the next 12 months.
In January 2025, we received several assessments from the German Tax Authorities (GTA) regarding the German extraterritorial taxation of royalty payments betweennonresidents (referred to as oﬀshore receipts in respect of intangible property or ORIP) and intellectual property transfers by nonresidents (referred to as extraterritorial capitalgains taxation or ETT). If the assessment is upheld, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $92.0 million. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but couldoccur in the next 12 months.
We ﬁrmly believe that the IRB and GTA assessments are without merit and we plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve thesematters. We intend to vigorously defend our position, and we are conﬁdent in our ability to prevail on the merits. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resultingfrom examinations such as these to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. The ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRB or GTA were to prevailon their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deﬁciency interest could have a material adverse impact on our ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses.  Companies ofour size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct signiﬁcant operations.  For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S.state tax returns, our ﬁscal 2007 and later tax returns remain eﬀectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities inthe U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record beneﬁts for uncertain tax positions based on anassessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, notax beneﬁt of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax beneﬁt that is more than 50% likely to be realized uponultimate settlement.
In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inﬂation Reduction Act into law. The Inﬂation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CorporateAMT) of 15.0% on the adjusted ﬁnancial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.00 billion over a three-year period, as well as a 1% excise tax onthe net fair market value of stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The Corporate AMT was in eﬀect beginning in ﬁscal 2024. The Inﬂation Reduction Act did not have amaterial impact on our tax expense or eﬀective tax rate during the six months ending September 30, 2025.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has introduced a global minimum corporate tax framework (GMT), with phased implementation startingJanuary 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not adopted GMT, several countries where we operate have enacted related legislation, and others are expected to follow. In June 2025, theGroup of Seven, comprised of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. (the G7), agreed to exclude U.S. Multi-National Entities from certain aspects of the GMT(the G7 Statement). We will continue to monitor developments around this agreement. The impact of the GMT for the six months ending September 30, 2025 was not material toour ﬁnancial results.
On July 4, 2025, the U.S. president signed into law H.R.1 – One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which includes permanent extensions of certain Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisionsand changes to the international tax framework. The eﬀects of these changes has been recognized in the period ending September 30, 2025. The impact of OBBBA for the sixmonths ended September 30, 2025 was not material to our ﬁnancial results. We will continue to evaluate the broader implications of OBBBA, including the eﬀects of futureregulatory guidance and interpretations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources We had $236.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2025, a decrease of $534.9 million from the March 31, 2025 balance.

 Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $363.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to net income of $23.1 million, adjusted for non-cashand non-operating charges of $476.7 million and net cash outflows of $136.1 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes inoperating assets and liabilities in the six months ended September 30, 2025 include a decrease in income tax payable due to tax payments and settlements, an increase in tradeaccounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue and timing of shipments and collections, a decrease in accrued liabilities primarily due to cash refunded to our customersunder certain LTSAs, oﬀset by a decrease in inventories as a result of our eﬀorts to balance manufacturing production, customer demand and inventory levels. Net cash providedby operating activities was $420.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to net income of $207.7 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operatingcharges of $425.0 million and net cash outflows of $212.0 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $98.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $189.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024.During the six months ended September 30, 2025, and the six months ended September 30, 2024, net investing activities primarily related to capital purchases and investments inother assets.
Our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. Capital expenditures in the six months ended September30, 2025 were $54.4 million compared to $93.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. Capital expenditures were primarily for the selective expansion of productioncapacity and the addition of research and development equipment. We have paused most of our factory expansion actions and reduced our planned capital investments throughﬁscal 2026. Our investments in equipment and facilities during the next 12 months are expected to be at or below $100.0 million. We believe that the capital expendituresanticipated to be incurred over the next 12 months will provide suﬃcient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products andtechnologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. We expect to ﬁnance our capital expenditures through our existingcash balances and cash ﬂows from operations.  Despite pausing our expansion activity, we believe that our current inventory and production capacity are adequate to fulﬁll theprojected requirements of our customers. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment taxcredit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry. In December 2023, we reached a Preliminary Memorandum of Terms with the U.S. Department of Commercefor $162 million in CHIPS Act grants for two of our U.S. wafer fabrication facilities; however, we have not concluded negotiations with the U.S. Department of Commerce and therecan be no assurance that the grants will receive ﬁnal approval. If we do receive a CHIPS Act grant, the restrictions and operational requirements that are imposed on CHIPS Actgrant recipients could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs. We expect to receive the cash beneﬁt associated with the investment tax credit for qualifyingcapital expenditures in future periods and may apply for other incentives provided by the legislation; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such otherincentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive ornegative impact on our competitive position. Financing Activities
Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities was $799.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $264.6 million in the six months ended September 30,2024. Signiﬁcant transactions aﬀecting our net ﬁnancing cash ﬂows included:
• in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026, $1.20 billion of net cash used to paydown our 4.25% 2025 Notes and $938.3 million of net proceeds generated from ourCommercial Paper program, and• in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2025, $328.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of our 2024 Senior Convertible Debt and our Commercial Paper, oﬀset by thepurchase of our capped call options, and the paydown of our 0.983% 2024 Notes, and• in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026 and ﬁscal 2025, we paid cash dividends to our common stockholders of $491.3 million and $486.3 million, respectively, and• in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026, we paid cash dividends to our preferred stockholders of $52.9 million, and• in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2025, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $90.0 million.
In March 2025, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) pursuant to which the CreditAgreement, was amended and restated in its entirety. The Second Amended
35
Table of Contents
and Restated Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.25 billion, with a $250.0 million foreign currencysublimit, a $25.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $20.0 million swingline loan sublimit. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended the maximum totalleverage ratio ﬁnancial covenant to the following: 5.50 to 1.00 for period ending March 31, 2025, 5.50 to 1.00 for period ending June 30, 2025, 6.25 to 1.00 for period endingSeptember 30, 2025, 5.75 to 1.00 for period ending December 31, 2025, 4.75 to 1.00 for period ending March 31, 2026, 4.00 to 1.00 for period ending June 30, 2026, 3.75 to 1.00for period ending September 30, 2026, and 3.50 to 1.00 for any such period ended after the Restatement Eﬀective Date that is not a period ending during the Covenant ReliefPeriod. The Covenant Relief Period means the period following the Restatement Eﬀective Date to (but excluding) the earlier of (a) December 31, 2026 and (b) the date in whichthe Total Leverage Ratio for the most recently ended ﬁscal quarter shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 and certain other conditions are satisﬁed.
In September 2023, we established a Commercial Paper program under which we may issue short-term unsecured promissory notes up to a maximum principal amountoutstanding at any time of $2.75 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper is sold from time to time at a discount from par oralternatively, sold at par and bears interest rates that will vary based on market conditions and the time of issuance. Our intent is to reduce the amounts that would otherwise beavailable to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility by the outstanding amount of Commercial Paper. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, inMarch 2025, the maximum principal amount outstanding at any time under the Commercial Paper program is $2.25 billion. As of September 30, 2025, the principal amount of ouroutstanding indebtedness was $5.41 billion. We had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2025 and at March 31, 2025. AtSeptember 30, 2025, we had $1.12 billion outstanding principal amount of Commercial Paper compared to $175.0 million at March 31, 2025.
In March 2025, we issued 29.7 million Depositary Shares, representing approximately 1.5 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock has a$1,000.00 per share liquidation preference and $0.001 per share par value. As a result of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $1.45 billion, net of underwriting fees andother issuance costs.
Dividends and Share Repurchases
In November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.No shares were repurchased under this authorization in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026. In the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2025, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares ofour common stock for $90.0 million under this authorization. As of September 30, 2025, approximately $1.56 billion remained available for repurchases under the program. As ofSeptember 30, 2025, we held approximately 38.0 million shares as treasury shares. Any future repurchases of shares of our common stock will be evaluated based on our cashgeneration, leverage metrics, and market conditions.
In October 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.  To date, our cumulative dividendpayments on our common stock have totaled approximately $8.12 billion. A quarterly dividend of $0.455 per share of common stock was declared on November 6, 2025 and willbe paid on December 9, 2025 to stockholders of record as of November 24, 2025. We expect the aggregate cash dividend on our common stock for the December 2025 quarter tobe approximately $246.1 million. Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on ourcommon stock on the basis of our results of operations, ﬁnancial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.  Ourcurrent intent is to maintain our level of quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.
With respect to shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, dividends are cumulative at an annual rate of 7.50% on the liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share of Series APreferred Stock. A quarterly cash dividend of $18.750 per share of Series A Preferred Stock was paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock on September 15, 2025 in theaggregate amount of $27.8 million. To date, our cumulative dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock have totaled approximately $52.9 million. A quarterly cash dividendof $18.750 per share of Series A Preferred Stock was declared on November 6, 2025 and will be paid on December 15, 2025 to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock of record asof December 1, 2025.
We believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from issuance ofour Commercial Paper will be suﬃcient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily arisefrom working capital requirements, interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness, capital

expenditures, cash dividends, share repurchases, and income tax payments. For additional information regarding our cash requirements see "Note 10. Commitments andContingencies", "Note 6. Debt" and "Note 11. Income Taxes" to our condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order toremain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make signiﬁcant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development and toexpand our existing facilities or potentially construct new facilities.  We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Commercial Paper program or seekadditional equity or debt ﬁnancing from time to time to reﬁnance our existing debt, maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cashdividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.  In addition, the holders of our 2024 Senior Convertible Debt can require us to repurchase such debt onJune 1, 2027 if the price per share of our common stock is less than the conversion price of such debt on the applicable measurement date. Our intention is to ﬁnance anyrequired repurchase of the 2024 Senior Convertible Debt by using availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, our Commercial Paper program or other debt or equity ﬁnancing.The timing and amount of any such ﬁnancing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the maturity dates of our existing debt, our level of dividend paymentson our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of oﬀshore cash, demand for our products, changes in industryconditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates.  We plan to reﬁnance certain of our existing notes as they mature and wemay from time to time seek to reﬁnance certain of our other outstanding debt or Convertible Debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, term loans, CommercialPaper, tender oﬀers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases. Such issuances, tender oﬀers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing marketconditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors. There can be no assurance that any ﬁnancing will be available on acceptable termsdue to uncertainties resulting from tariﬀs, high interest rates, high inﬂation, economic uncertainty, instability in the banking sector, public health concerns, or other factors, andany additional equity ﬁnancing or convertible debt ﬁnancing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk
As of September 30, 2025, our current and long-term debt totaled $5.41 billion, all of which was ﬁxed rate and not subject to interest rate exposure. We intend to ﬁnance therepayment of our ﬁxed rate debt maturing within the next 12 months using available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, our Commercial Paper program or otherinstruments at which point, changes in interest rates will have a more signiﬁcant impact on our interest expense if we reﬁnance such ﬁxed rate debt with variable rate debt. Foradditional information, refer to "Note 6. Debt" for a summary of our debt obligations by maturity date.
Inﬂation Risk
Inﬂation has not had a material adverse impact on our operating results in recent periods. However, if our costs were to continue to become subject to signiﬁcant inﬂationarypressures, we may not be able to oﬀset such higher costs through price increases which could adversely impact our operating results.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, we evaluatedunder the supervision of our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, the eﬀectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(e) or15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and our Chief Financial Oﬃcer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedureswere eﬀective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we ﬁle or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reportedwithin the time periods speciﬁed in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our ChiefExecutive Oﬃcer and our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed toprovide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management.  Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of ourinternal control over ﬁnancial reporting.  Management's assessment of the eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonableassurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives willbe met.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2025, there was no change in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting identiﬁed in connection with the evaluationrequired by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that has materially aﬀected, or is reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, our internal control overﬁnancial reporting.

Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry
Our operating results are impacted by global economic conditions and may ﬂuctuate in the future due to a number of factors that could reduce our net sales andproﬁtability.
Our operating results are aﬀected by a wide variety of factors that could reduce our net sales and proﬁtability, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the factors thatmay aﬀect our operating results include:
• general economic, industry, public health or political conditions in the U.S. or internationally, including uncertain economic conditions in U.S., China and Europe,changes in tariﬀs, interest rates, persistent inﬂation or instability in the banking sector;• trade restrictions and increase in tariﬀs, including those on business in China, or focused on speciﬁc companies or types of products;• levels of inventories held by our customers and the customers of our distributors;• the mix of inventory we hold and our ability to satisfy orders from our inventory;• the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter, including the impact of product lead times;• disruptions in our business, our supply chain or our customers' businesses due to public health concerns (including viral outbreaks and pandemics), cybersecurityincidents, terrorist activity, armed conﬂict, war (including military conﬂict in the Middle East and Russia's invasion of Ukraine), worldwide oil prices and supply, ﬁres,natural disasters or disruptions in the transportation system;• changes in demand or market acceptance of our products and products of our customers, and market ﬂuctuations in the industries into which such products aresold;• our ability to introduce new products that will achieve broad market acceptance at favorable prices and margins;• availability of raw materials including rare earth minerals, supplies and equipment due to supply chain constraints, disruptions in transportation systems, traderestrictions, or other factors;• constrained availability from other electronic suppliers or disruptions in transit systems impacting our customers' ability to ship their products, which in turn mayadversely impact our sales to those customers;• the level of order cancellations or push-outs due to uncertain economic conditions or other factors;• our ability to decrease or increase our factory capacity as needed to respond to changes in customer demand;• our ability to secure suﬃcient wafer foundry, assembly and testing capacity;• increased costs and availability of raw materials, supplies, equipment, utilities, labor, and/or subcontracted services for wafers, assembly and test;• changes in utilization of our manufacturing capacity and ﬂuctuations in manufacturing yields;• changes or ﬂuctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;
41
Table of Contents
• changes in tax regulations in countries in which we do business;• new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices;• risk of excess and obsolete inventories;• competitive developments including pricing pressures;• unauthorized copying of our products resulting in pricing pressure and loss of sales;• our ability to successfully transition to more advanced process technologies to reduce manufacturing costs or introduce more advanced products, and the ability toproduce these products at desired volumes, such as our ﬁrst 3nm PCIe Gen 6 Switch;• the level of sell-through of our products through distribution or resale;• ﬂuctuations in our mix of product sales;• our ability to realize the expected beneﬁts of our past or future acquisitions;• announcements of other signiﬁcant acquisitions by us or our competitors;• costs and outcomes of any current or future tax audits or any litigation, investigation or claims involving intellectual property, our acquisitions, customers or otherissues; and• property damage or other losses, whether or not covered by insurance.
Period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon any such comparisons as indications of our futureperformance. In future periods, our operating results may fall below our public guidance or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which would likely have anegative eﬀect on the price of our common stock. Uncertain global economic and public health conditions have caused and may in the future cause our operating results toﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly and make comparisons between periods less meaningful.
Our operating results may be adversely impacted by the ﬁnancial viability and performance of our licensees, customers, distributors, resellers or suppliers.
We regularly review the ﬁnancial viability and performance of our licensees, customers, distributors, resellers and suppliers. Any downturn in global or regional economicconditions as a result of the enactment of broad sanctions or tariﬀs by the U.S. or other countries, high interest rates, high inﬂation, instability in the banking sector, public healthconcerns, industry work stoppages, transit stoppages or other factors, may adversely impact their ﬁnancial viability. The ﬁnancial decline of a large licensee, customer, reseller ordistributor, an important supplier, or a group thereof, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could result in our inability to collect our accounts receivablebalances, higher allowances for credit losses, and higher operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Also, these parties may not comply with their contractual commitments, ormay interpret them diﬀerently than we do, which could lead to termination of their performance with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate ourexposure. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent, ﬁles for bankruptcy, has business leverage, or favorable contractual terms, then our ability to recover any losses suﬀeredas a result of that counterparty's cessation of performance may be limited by their liquidity, the applicable laws, or their willingness to negotiate a resolution. In the event of suchdefault or cessation of performance, we could incur signiﬁcant losses, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations, or ﬁnancial condition.
We have various arrangements with ﬁnancial institutions for our cash deposits, and other banking activities, that subject us to risk if such institutions were to experienceﬁnancial or regulatory diﬃculties. As a result, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and cash equivalents due to failures of ﬁnancial institutions or other relatedparties.
We may lose sales if suppliers of raw materials, components or equipment fail to meet our or our customers' needs, increase prices, are impacted by increases in tariﬀs, orsuch raw materials, components or equipment become restricted or unavailable.
Our manufacturing operations require raw and processed materials and equipment that must meet exacting standards.  We generally have multiple sources for thesesupplies, but there may be a limited number of suppliers capable of meeting our standards.  We have experienced supply shortages from time to time in the past, and on occasionour suppliers have told us they need more time to ﬁll our orders, that they cannot ﬁll certain orders, that they will no longer support certain equipment with updates or parts, orthat they are increasing prices. In particular, in ﬁscal 2023 and in ﬁscal 2022, we experienced increased prices at certain suppliers for certain materials required for productionpurposes. However, in ﬁscal 2024 and ﬁscal 2025, the pricing environment stabilized compared to the two prior ﬁscal years. An interruption of any materials or equipmentsources, or the lack of supplier support for a particular piece of equipment, could harm our business. The supplies necessary for our business could become more diﬃcult toobtain as worldwide use of semiconductors increases, or due to supply chain disruptions, transit disruptions, tariﬀs, trade restrictions or political instability. Additionally,consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. Also, the reduced availability ofnecessary labor, the application of sanctions, trade restrictions or tariﬀs by the U.S. or other
42
Table of Contents
countries or the impact of public health concerns, may adversely impact the industry supply chain. The U.S. has imposed additional tariﬀs on imports, and certain countries haveimposed retaliatory tariﬀs on imports that have the U.S. as their country of origin. For example, in 2025, the U.S imposed tariﬀs on imports from China and other countries andforeign governments imposed tariﬀs on imports from the U.S. It is unclear what tariﬀs will apply to semiconductors at this time.
Supply interruptions or additional tariﬀs imposed on components, raw materials, or equipment may increase our costs and have an adverse impact on our operating results infuture periods. We also have in the past and may in the future incur increases in manufacturing costs in taking actions which are designed to mitigate the impact of supplyinterruptions or tariﬀs on our operations. We will attempt to mitigate the impact of these various supply interruptions and tariﬀs on our business but may experience an increasein operating costs, impaired sourcing ﬂexibility, and reduced demand for our products, resulting in reduced revenue.
Our customers may also be adversely aﬀected by the tariﬀs, supply interruptions and other issues described above. The labor, supplies and equipment necessary for theirbusinesses could become more diﬃcult to obtain for various reasons not limited to business interruptions of suppliers, reduced availability of supplies, components, or labor,transit disruptions, consolidation in their supply chain, or sanctions, trade restrictions or tariﬀs or the impact of public health concerns that impair sourcing ﬂexibility or increasecosts. If our customers are not able to produce their products, then their need for our products will decrease. Such interruptions of our customers’ businesses could harm ourbusiness. For example, on September 30, 2025, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned, Netherlands-based based chip company that manufactureschips used in the automotive and consumer electronics industries. On October 4, 2025, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued export controls which prohibit export ofNexperia products out of China. Various automotive and consumer electronics manufacturers may be adversely impacted by the Nexperia chip supply interruptions, resulting in adecrease in automotive and consumer electronics production, and a decrease in demand for our products by such customers. This decrease in demand could adversely impact ouroperating results.
We do not, nor have we historically, purchased signiﬁcant amounts of equipment from Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine. However, the semiconductor industry, and purchasers ofsemiconductors, use raw materials that are sourced from these regions, such as neon, palladium, cesium, rubidium, and nickel. If we, or our direct or indirect customers, areunable to obtain the requisite raw materials or components needed to manufacture products, our ability to manufacture products, or demand for our products, may be adverselyimpacted. This could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations or ﬁnancial condition. While there has been an adverse impact on the world’s palladium,neon, cesium, and rubidium supply chains, at this time, our supply chains have been able to meet our needs. While sales of our products into Russia, Belarus and Ukraine and tocustomers that sell into these countries, have been negatively impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at this time, we have not experienced a material impact on ourbusiness, results of operations or ﬁnancial conditions. Further, because we do not support the actions of Russia against Ukraine, in March 2022 we stopped selling products tocustomers and distributors located in Russia and Belarus.
Additionally, certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals. Trade disputes, geopoliticaltensions, economic circumstances, transit disruptions, political conditions, or public health issues, may limit our ability to obtain materials or equipment. Although rare earth andother materials are available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. In April 2025, China imposed export restrictions on certainrare earth minerals. In October 2025, China added controls to additional elements and added a license requirement for export of these elements and related magnets to foreignmanufacturers. If China were to further restrict or stop exporting these materials or pressure other countries to do so, our suppliers' ability to obtain such supply may beconstrained and we may be unable to obtain suﬃcient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earthelements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it diﬃcult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memorymanufacturers who are able to obtain suﬃcient quantities of these materials from China or other countries. Such a constraint may also impact our customers. For example, thecontrols on rare earth magnets caused certain automotive manufacturers to pause operations. Such interruptions in our downstream markets could adversely impact the demandfor our products.
We are dependent on wafer foundries and other contractors, as are our SuperFlash and other licensees.
We rely on outside wafer foundries for a signiﬁcant portion of our wafer fabrication needs. Speciﬁcally, during the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026, approximately 65% of our netsales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries compared to 64% of our net sales in ﬁscal 2025. We also use several contractors for a portion of theassembly and testing of our products. Speciﬁcally, during the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026, approximately 32% of our assembly requirements and 31% of our test requirementswere performed by third-party contractors, compared to approximately 33% and 33%, respectively, during ﬁscal 2025. We have long-term commitment contracts with certain ofour third-party suppliers
43
Table of Contents
to help ensure that we receive capacity from them to manufacture wafers and assemble and test our products. Due to decreased demand for our products in recent periods, wehave taken actions to decrease our capacity allocation from our wafer fabrication, assembly and test subcontractors. However, we could still purchase products or services eventhough we currently do not need them in order to take advantage of contract credits. This could result in excess inventory and inventory reserve charges that may negatively aﬀectour gross margin and results of operations. Additionally, if we have a need for greater manufacturing, assembly or test capacity in the future, there can be no assurance that wewill be able to secure the necessary allocation of capacity from our wafer foundries and other contractors with the process technologies that we need, or that such capacity will beavailable on acceptable terms. As our manufacturing subcontractors move to more advanced process technologies over time, we may ﬁnd that they do not invest in some of thetrailing edge process technologies on which a large portion of our products are manufactured. If this occurs, it may limit the amounts of net sales that we can achieve or require usto make signiﬁcant investments to be able to manufacture these products in our own facilities or at other foundries and assembly and testing contractors.
We expect that our reliance on third party contractors may increase over time as our business grows, and any inability to secure necessary external capacity could adverselyaﬀect our operating results. Transitioning production of products to new manufacturers may result in delayed product launches, reduced yields, or decreased productperformance. If we encounter issues with product quality, insuﬃcient capacity from a third-party manufacturer, or if we discontinue using a particular manufacturer or contractor,we may face challenges in securing an alternative supply for speciﬁc products in a timely manner. This could lead to signiﬁcant delays in product shipments, potentially having anadverse impact on our results of operations. If our reliance on third-party contractors increases over time, our inability to secure necessary external capacity could adversely aﬀectour operating results.
In August 2022, the U.S. government passed the CHIPS Act to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domesticmanufacturing capacity in our industry. We have received and expect to continue to receive the cash beneﬁt associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capitalexpenditures in future periods and applied for other incentives provided by the legislation; however, we have not concluded negotiations with the U.S. Department of Commerceand there can be no assurance that we will pursue or receive any such other incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which othercompanies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position. If we conclude our CHIPS Act negotiations andreceive a CHIPS Act grant, the restrictions and operational requirements that are imposed on CHIPS Act grant recipients could add complexity to our operations and increase ourcosts.
Our use of third parties reduces our control over the subcontracted portions of our business. Our future operating results could suﬀer if a signiﬁcant contractor were toexperience production diﬃculties, insuﬃcient capacity, decreased manufacturing, reduced availability of labor, assembly and test yields, or increased costs due to disruptions suchas political upheaval, transit disruptions, infrastructure disruption or pandemics. Additionally, our future operating results could suﬀer if our wafer foundries and other contractorsincrease the prices of the products and services that they provide to us. If third parties do not timely deliver products or services in accordance with our quality standards, we maybe unable to qualify alternate manufacturing sources in a timely manner or on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, these subcontractors could abandon processes that weneed, or fail to adopt technologies that we desire to control costs. In such event, we could experience an interruption in production, an increase in manufacturing costs or adecline in product reliability, and our business and operating results could be adversely aﬀected. Further, use of subcontractors increases the risks of misappropriation of ourintellectual property.
Certain of our SuperFlash and other technology licensees rely on wafer foundries. If our licensees experienced disruption in supply at such foundries, this would reduce therevenue from our technology licensing business and would harm our operating results.
We are highly dependent on foreign sales, suppliers, and operations, which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks.
Sales to foreign customers account for a substantial portion of our net sales. During the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026, approximately 76% of our net sales were made toforeign customers, including 18% in China and 15% in Taiwan. During ﬁscal 2025, approximately 75% of our net sales were made to foreign customers, including 17% in China and16% in Taiwan.
Having a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. Although our sales in the Chinese market were very strong in calendar 2021,competition in China is intense, and China's economic growth slowed in calendar 2022 and through the ﬁrst half of calendar 2023. In ﬁscal 2024, ﬁscal 2025 and in the ﬁrst half ofﬁscal 2026, economic weakness in the Chinese market adversely impacted our sales volumes in China. As discussed above, the trade
44
Table of Contents
relationship between the U.S. and China remains challenging and could worsen, economic conditions in China remain uncertain, and we are unable to predict whether suchuncertainty will continue or worsen in future periods. Any increase in tariﬀs on semiconductors and raw materials that have the U.S. as their country of origin could lower demandfor our products in China and other countries. For example, on September 13, 2025, China's Ministry of Commerce initiated an antidumping investigation of imports into China ofanalog chips originating in the United States. While we are not a subject of this investigation, additional tariﬀs are likely to be imposed as a result of this investigation and couldhave an adverse impact on our revenue. Further, increasing investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned of aﬃliated entitiesare intended to advance China's stated national policy objectives. The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market, or may prevent us fromcompeting eﬀectively with Chinese companies. Weakening of foreign markets, especially in China, has resulted in lower demand for our products, which has adversely impactedour revenue in recent quarters and, if such conditions continue, it could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations or ﬁnancial conditions.
We purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers. Please see the risks related to access to raw materials, components, orequipment on page 42. In addition, we own product assembly and testing facilities, and ﬁnished goods warehouses near Bangkok, Thailand, which has experienced periods ofpolitical instability and severe ﬂooding in the past. There can be no assurance that any future ﬂooding or political instability in Thailand would not have a material adverse impacton our operations. We have a test facility in Calamba, the Philippines, and specialized test and assembly facilities for our aerospace and defense products in Germany, France,Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States. We use foundries and other foreign contractors for a signiﬁcant portion of our assembly and testingand wafer fabrication requirements.
Our reliance on foreign operations, foreign suppliers, maintenance of substantially all of our ﬁnished goods inventory at foreign locations and signiﬁcant foreign sales exposesus to foreign political and economic risks, including, but not limited to:
• economic uncertainty in the worldwide markets we serve;• trade restrictions and changes in tariﬀs;• political instability, including changes in relations between China and Taiwan which could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan-based third-party wafer foundries,and subcontractors;• social and economic instability due to public health concerns, wars, or other factors;• supply chain disruptions or delays;• potentially adverse tax consequences;• import and export license requirements and restrictions;• changes in laws related to taxes, trade, environmental, health and safety, technical standards, climate change, and consumer protection;• restrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively aﬀect the amount and timing of certain customer payments, and asa results our cash ﬂows;• currency ﬂuctuations and foreign exchange regulations;• diﬃculties in staﬃng and managing international operations;• employment regulations;• disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents;• disruptions in international transport or delivery;• public health conditions (including viral outbreaks such as COVID-19); and• diﬃculties in collecting receivables and longer payment cycles.
If any of these risks occur or are worse than we anticipate, our sales could decrease and our operating results could suﬀer, we could face an increase in the cost ofcomponents, production delays, business interruptions, delays in obtaining export licenses, or denials of such licenses, tariﬀs and trade restrictions, longer payment cycles,increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse eﬀecton our business. Further changes in trade policy, tariﬀs, additional taxes, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit ourability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell productsor purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations, or ﬁnancial conditions.
We depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and have limited visibility to product shipments other than orders placed under certain LTSAs.
Our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog, and orders that are both
45
Table of Contents
received and shipped in the same quarter, which we call turns orders. We measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipmenttargets that we set entering the quarter. Historically, our ability to respond quickly to customer orders has been part of our competitive strategy, resulting in customers placingorders with relatively short delivery schedules. Shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter andreduce our visibility on future shipments. Turns orders correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times, and in light of current industry conditions,turns orders are once again key to our ability to meet our business objectives. Because turns orders can be diﬃcult to predict, especially in times of economic volatility andchanges in tariﬀs, as experienced in current and recent quarters, where customers may change order levels within the quarter, varying levels of turns orders make it more diﬃcultto forecast net sales. The level of turns orders has in the past and may in the future decrease in periods where customers are holding excess inventory of our products. We believeour customers increased their order levels in ﬁscal 2021 and in ﬁscal 2022 in periods of tight supply to help ensure they had suﬃcient inventory of our products to meet theirneeds, and then they were unable to sell their products at their forecasted levels which reduced our level of turns orders. As a signiﬁcant portion of our products aremanufactured at foundries, foundry lead times may aﬀect our ability to satisfy certain turns orders. If we do not achieve a suﬃcient level of turns orders in a particular quarterrelative to our revenue targets or eﬀectively manage our production based on changes in order forecasts, our revenue and operating results will likely suﬀer.
Starting in the ﬁrst quarter of calendar 2022, we began entering into LTSAs, which oﬀer our customers the ability to receive prioritized capacity. LTSAs are not a guarantee ofsupply; however, they were designed to provide the highest priority for those orders which were under this program, and the capacity priority was on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-servedbasis until the available capacity was booked. This program has resulted in some customers holding excess inventory of our products and thus decreased their need to place neworders, including turns orders, in recent periods. We built inventories in response to customer demand, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders has resulted in excessinventory, which has resulted in write-downs of inventory and an adverse eﬀect on our gross margins in recent periods.
Intense competition in the markets we serve may lead to pricing pressures, reduced sales or reduced market share.
The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and faces price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and internationalsemiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and substantially greater ﬁnancial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do.In addition, some governments, such as China, may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, signiﬁcant assistance ﬁnancial or otherwise, to some of ourcompetitors, or to new entrants, and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors, including trying to disrupt the U.S. semiconductor industry. Thesemiconductor industry has experienced signiﬁcant consolidation in recent years which has resulted in several of our competitors becoming much larger in terms of revenue,product oﬀerings and scale. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future, which could harm our business. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number offactors, including, but not limited to:
• changes in demand in the markets that we serve and the overall rate of growth or contraction of such markets, including but not limited to the automotive, personalcomputing and consumer electronics markets;• our success in designing and manufacturing new products including those implementing new technologies, including AI, or complying with new governmentalrestrictions regarding implementation of new technologies;• the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their applications and the success of such applications;• product introductions by our competitors or by us in response to actions taken by our competitors;• our ability to obtain adequate foundry and assembly and test capacity and supplies at acceptable prices;• our ability to ramp production and increase capacity as needed, at our wafer fabrication and assembly and test facilities;• the quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of our products;• the rate at which the markets that we serve redesign and change their own products, including in response to market changes caused by developing technologiessuch as AI and other market forces;• the number, nature and success of our competitors in a given market;• our ability to protect our products and processes by eﬀective utilization of intellectual property rights;• our ability to address the needs of our customers;• our ability to attract and retain talent, including talent with expertise in developing areas such as AI; and• general market and economic conditions.
Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of a product.  The average selling prices of our mixed-signal microcontroller, FPGAproducts, and proprietary products in our analog product line have remained relatively constant over time, while average selling prices of our memory and non-proprietaryproducts in our analog product
46
Table of Contents
line have declined over time. The overall average selling price of our products is aﬀected by these trends; however, variations in our product and geographic mix of sales can causewider ﬂuctuations in our overall average selling price in any given period.
We have experienced, and may experience in the future, pricing declines in certain of our proprietary product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. In the past, wehave moderated average selling price declines in many of our proprietary product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. However, we may notbe able to do so in the future. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, competitive pricing pressures on our products. In ﬁscal 2023 and ﬁscal 2022, weexperienced cost increases which we were able to pass on to our customers. However, in the future, we may be unable to maintain average selling prices due to an oversupply ofproduct in the market or increased pricing pressure, including as a result of tariﬀs being applied to the products we sell or purchase, or actions taken by foreign governments suchas China to favor companies located in their own country through tariﬀs or other actions, which could adversely impact our operating results.
We, and our competitors, seek to improve yields, and reduce die size, which could result in signiﬁcant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices.Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor products, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for ourproducts, and could materially adversely aﬀect our business, results of operations, or ﬁnancial condition.
Our success depends on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis.
Our future operating results depend on our ability to develop and timely introduce new products that compete eﬀectively on the basis of price and performance and whichaddress customer requirements. The success of our new product introductions depends on various factors, including, but not limited to:
• understanding and predicting changes in the market segments that we serve, including changes driven by AI;• eﬀective new product selection;• timely completion and introduction of new product designs, and the ability to produce these products at desired volumes, including those developed on moreadvanced technology nodes such as our ﬁrst 3nm PCIe Gen 6 Switch;• availability of skilled employees;• procurement of licenses for intellectual property rights from third parties under commercially reasonable terms, including those that may be needed to oﬀerinteroperability between our products and third-party products;• implementation of appropriate technical standards developed by standard setting organizations;• timely ﬁling and protection of intellectual property rights for new product designs;
• the level of competition for our new products and how the features and prices of our new products compare with competing products;• availability of development and support tools and collateral literature that make complex new products easy for engineers to understand and use; and• market acceptance of our customers' end products.
Because our products are complex, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing new product development. New products may not receive or maintainsubstantial market acceptance.  We may be unable to timely design, develop and introduce competitive products, or produce them at desired volumes, which could adverselyimpact our future operating results.
Our success also depends upon our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies. Semiconductor design and process technologies are subject torapid technological change and require signiﬁcant R&D expenditures. We and others in the industry have, from time to time, experienced diﬃculties in transitioning to advancedprocess technologies and have suﬀered reduced manufacturing yields or delays in product deliveries. Our future operating results could be adversely aﬀected if any transition tofuture process technologies is substantially delayed or ineﬃciently implemented.
Our operating results will suﬀer if we ineﬀectively utilize our manufacturing capacity or fail to maintain manufacturing yields.
Integrated circuit manufacturing processes are complex and sensitive to many factors, including contaminants in the manufacturing environment or materials used, theperformance of our personnel and equipment, and other quality issues. As is typical in the industry, we have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturingyields. Our operating results will suﬀer if we are unable to maintain yields at or above approximately the current levels. This could include delays in
47
Table of Contents
the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, and penalties for failure to meet shipment deadlines. Our operating results are adversely aﬀected when we operate below normalcapacity. In the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026 and in ﬁscal 2025, we operated at below normal capacity levels resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of $102.5 million and$173.0 million, respectively. Additionally, as we are moving production between factories, including from Fab 2 to our Oregon and Colorado facilities, we may experience lowerthan anticipated yields during this transition.
Our operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide ﬂuctuations of supply and demand in the industry.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by seasonality and wide ﬂuctuations of supply and demand.  Historically, since a signiﬁcant portion of our revenue is frominternational sales and consumer markets, our business generates stronger revenues in the ﬁrst half and comparatively weaker revenues in the second half of our ﬁscal year.However, broad ﬂuctuations in our business, changes in semiconductor industry and global economic conditions have had and can have a more signiﬁcant impact on our resultsthan seasonality. In periods when broad ﬂuctuations, changes in business conditions or acquisitions occur, it is diﬃcult to assess the impact of seasonality on our business. Thesemiconductor industry has had signiﬁcant economic downturns (including in recent periods), characterized by diminished product demand, production over-capacity and highinventory levels. We have sought to reduce our exposure to this industry cyclicality by selling proprietary products, that cannot be quickly replaced, to a geographically diversecustomer base across a broad range of market segments. However, we have experienced substantial period-to-period ﬂuctuations in operating results and expect, in the future, toexperience period-to-period ﬂuctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions. In this regard, many of our customers felt the eﬀects of slowingeconomic activity and increasing business uncertainty, and customer requests to push-out or cancel backlog increased in the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2023, in ﬁscal 2024 and inmost of ﬁscal 2025, which adversely impacted our revenue in recent periods. Consistent with the slowing macroeconomic environment, and the growth in our inventory, we havepaused our factory expansion actions at Fab 4 and Fab 5 and reduced our planned capital investments through ﬁscal 2026. We are unable to predict the duration or continuedimpact of the current or any future slowdown on our business.
Our business is dependent on distributors to service our end customers.
Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 46% of our net sales in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026 and approximately 45% of our net sales in ﬁscal 2025. With theexception of certain orders placed under our LTSAs, we do not have long-term purchase agreements with our distributors, and we and our distributors may each terminate ourrelationship with little or no advance notice.
Future adverse conditions in the U.S. or global economies, labor markets, or credit markets, whether resulting from tariﬀs or other factors, could materially impact distributoroperations. Any deterioration in the ﬁnancial condition, disruption in the operations of our distributors, or disruption of our ability to conduct business with our distributors wouldlikely adversely impact the ﬂow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operation. For example, on October 8, 2025, certain subsidiaries ofArrow Electronics (Arrow) were placed on the U.S. Department of Commerce Entity List. As a result, we could not ship or transfer products or other items that are governed by theU.S. Export Administration regulations (EAR) to those entities until they were removed from the Entity List. Nine days later, the U.S. Department of Commerce authorized Arrowand its subsidiaries to continue with certain transactions and indicated that Arrow and its subsidiaries would be removed from the Entity List. We worked to minimize disruptionsin our supply chain during this period. There was no material impact to Microchip or its customers as a result of this interruption in shipments to certain subsidiaries of Arrow. Inaddition, during an industry or economic downturn (including in recent periods), there may be an oversupply and decrease in demand for our products, which could reduce ournet sales in a given period, increase order push-outs, increase inventory returns, and cause us to carry elevated levels of inventory. For example, in the fourth quarter of ﬁscal2023, in ﬁscal 2024 and in ﬁscal 2025, we accommodated requests by end customers to push-out certain distributor orders to help them manage inventory levels and, in somecases, to help other end customers that are experiencing supply shortages. As a result of the foregoing, we incurred charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventory, or wemay not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and sanction laws, or similar laws, by ourdistributors could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Business interruptions to our operations or those of our key vendors, licensees or customers could harm our business.
Operations at any of our facilities, at the facilities of any of our wafer fabrication or assembly and test subcontractors, or at any of our signiﬁcant vendors, licensees orcustomers may be disrupted due to public health concerns (including outbreaks such as COVID-19), work stoppages or reduction in available labor, power loss, insuﬃcient water,cyber-attacks, computer network compromises, incidents of terrorism or security risk, tariﬀs, political instability, governmental actions, telecommunications, transportation orother infrastructure failure, radioactive contamination, adverse changes in climate, or
48
Table of Contents
ﬁres, earthquakes, ﬂoods, droughts, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of some of these events should they occur; however,we cannot be certain that we will avoid a signiﬁcant impact on our business in the event of a business interruption. For example, in August 2024, we determined that anunauthorized party disrupted our use of certain servers and some of our business operations. As a result, certain of our manufacturing facilities were operating at less than normallevels for a period of time, and our ability to fulﬁll orders was temporarily impacted. While we were able to bring the aﬀected portions of our IT systems back online and restorenormal business operations in response to this August 2024 incident without a material impact to our business, we cannot be certain that we would be able to achieve this resultin the event of another cyber incident. Separately, in the ﬁrst three months of ﬁscal 2023 and in ﬁscal 2022, COVID-19 related restrictions adversely impacted our manufacturingoperations in the U.S., the Philippines and Thailand along with our subcontractors' manufacturing operations in Malaysia, Taiwan and China. Similar challenges arose for ourlogistics service providers, which adversely impacted their ability to ship product to our customers. Any future pandemic could adversely impact our business in future periods ifpublic health issues again becomes severe in one or more of our key markets such as China or in areas where our suppliers or manufacturing operations are located. In the future,local governments could require us to reduce production or cease operations at any of our facilities, and we could experience constraints in fulﬁlling customer orders. Likewise, ifour licensees are unable to manufacture and ship products incorporating our technology, or if there is a decrease in product demand due to a business disruption, our royaltyrevenue may decline.
Also, Thailand has experienced periods of severe ﬂooding in recent years. While our facilities in Thailand have continued to operate normally, there can be no assurance thatfuture ﬂooding in Thailand would not have a material adverse impact on our operations. If operations at any of our facilities, or our subcontractors' facilities are interrupted, wemay not be able to timely shift production to other facilities, and we may need to spend signiﬁcant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment.  Businessinterruptions would likely cause delays in shipments of products to our customers, and alternate sources for production may be unavailable on acceptable terms. This could resultin reduced revenues, cancellation of orders, or loss of customers. Although we maintain business interruption insurance, such insurance will likely not compensate us for anylosses or damages, and business interruptions could signiﬁcantly harm our business. For more information on adverse climate change see our risk "Sustained adverse climatechange poses risks that could harm our results of operations" on page 63.
Our technology licensing business exposes us to various risks.
Our technology licensing business is based on our SuperFlash and other technologies. The success of our licensing business depends on the continued market acceptance ofthese technologies and on our ability to further develop such technologies, to introduce new technologies, and to enforce our license terms. To be successful, any such technologymust be able to be repeatably implemented by licensees, provide satisfactory yield rates, address licensee and customer requirements, and perform competitively. The success ofour technology licensing business depends on various other factors, including, but not limited to:
• proper identiﬁcation of licensee requirements;• timely development and introduction of new or enhanced technology;• our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights for our licensed technology, and enforce the terms of our licenses;• our ability to limit our liability and indemniﬁcation obligations to licensees;• availability of development and support services to assist licensees in their design and manufacture of products;• availability of foundry licensees with suﬃcient capacity to support OEM production; and• market acceptance of our customers' end products.
Because our licensed technologies are complex, there may be delays from time to time in developing and enhancing such technologies. There can be no assurance that ourexisting or any enhanced or new technology will achieve or maintain substantial market acceptance. Our licensees may experience disruptions in production or reducedproduction levels which would adversely aﬀect the revenue that we receive. Our technology license agreements generally include a clause that indemniﬁes the licensee againstliability and damages (including legal defense costs) arising from certain intellectual property matters. We could be exposed to substantial liability for claims or damages related tointellectual property matters or indemniﬁcation claims. We have a program to audit the royalty payments made by our licensees to help ensure that the payments are inaccordance with the terms of the applicable license agreements. From time to time, we or our licensees have contested the amount of royalty payments and related claims haveresulted and could result in signiﬁcant legal fees and require signiﬁcant attention from our management. These issues may adversely impact the success of our licensing businessand adversely aﬀect our future operating results.

Sales into governmental projects, and compliance with associated regulations, could have a material adverse eﬀect on our results of operations.
A signiﬁcant portion of our sales are from or are derived from government agencies or customers who sell to U.S. or foreign government agencies.  Such sales are subject tofederal contracting regulations as well as uncertainties regarding governmental spending levels, spending priorities, regulatory and policy changes.  Future sales into U.S. orforeign government projects are subject to uncertain government appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, including the budgetary process, changes in thetiming and spending priorities, the impact of any past or future government shutdowns, contract terminations or renegotiations, future sequestrations, changes in regulations thatwe must comply with to be eligible to accept new contracts, such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certiﬁcation requirements in the U.S., or the impact of pandemics.  Forexample, in ﬁscal 2022, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced suspensions and stop work orders for some of our subcontracts. Additionally, a section in the U.S.National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 (the NDAA 2023), signed into law on December 23, 2022, with provisions that go into eﬀect in December 2027, prohibits U.S.government agencies from buying semiconductor products or services manufactured by SMIC, YMTC, CXMT and any other entity that the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary ofCommerce determine is owned, controlled, or connected to the government of a foreign country of concern (Prohibited Companies). Some of our products are manufactured atSMIC, and some of our suppliers buy products manufactured at YMTC. If we are unable to alternately source or manufacture certain of our products, or discontinue use ofproducts from Prohibited Companies, if any, when Sections 805 and 5949 of the NDAA 2023 go into eﬀect in December 2027, this could adversely impact our sales to U.S.government agencies and their prime customers. Although such actions have not yet had a material adverse impact on our business, there can be no assurance as to the futurecosts or implications of such actions. Sales into government projects are also subject to uncertainties related to monetary, regulatory, and tax and trade policies implemented bycurrent or future administrations.
Delays, reductions in or terminations of government contracts or subcontracts, including those caused by any past, current, or future shutdown of the U.S. federal or foreigngovernments, could materially and adversely aﬀect our operating results. As of the date of the ﬁling of this report on Form 10-Q, the U.S. federal government has failed tocomplete their annual budget process or provide for a continuing resolution to fund government operations, resulting in a U.S. federal government shutdown. During theshutdown we may experience delays, reductions in or terminations of government purchases, contracts or subcontracts, which could materially and adversely aﬀect our operatingresults. We have not currently experienced adverse eﬀects due to the shutdown, but may if it continues. While we generally function as a subcontractor in these type oftransactions, further changes in U.S. or foreign government procurement regulations and practices, particularly surrounding initiatives to reduce costs or increase complianceobligations (such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certiﬁcation in the U.S.), may adversely impact the contracting environment, our ability to enter into or renew contracts,our ability to hire and retain employees, and our operating results.
The U.S. government and its contractors may terminate their contracts with us at any time. Uncertainty in government spending and termination of contracts for governmentrelated projects could have a material adverse impact on the revenue from our government-related business.  Our contracts with U.S. governmental agencies or prime customersrequire us to comply with the contract terms, and governmental regulations, particularly for our facilities, systems and personnel that service such customers and related tohandling of government-regulated data.  To be awarded new contracts after November 10, 2025 for the U.S. government, we may be required to meet certain levels of theCybersecurity Maturity Model Certiﬁcations that we may not meet, or may choose not to meet. Over time, more government contracts may require higher Cybersecurity MaturityModel Certiﬁcations and if we do not meet them, we will become ineligible for certain contracts. We are also required to have facility security clearances to perform classiﬁedcontracts and to build and sell classiﬁed products for U.S. governmental agencies. If personnel critical to our performance of these contracts are unable to obtain or maintain theirsecurity clearances, we may be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely aﬀect our results of operations. We mustalso comply with regulations regarding the handling of controlled unclassiﬁed information and export-controlled data, as well as U.S. Department of Defense cybersecurityrequirements (such as those under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Defense Acquisition Regulations (DFARS)). Complying with these regulations, including auditrequirements, requires that we devote signiﬁcant resources to such matters in terms of training, personnel, information technology and facilities. The increased cost ofcompliance may adversely aﬀect our operating results. In certain circumstances, failure to comply with these requirements, the terms of government contracts, or with otherapplicable regulations may result in ﬁnes and penalties, or loss of current or future business including our ability to continue as a supplier to U.S. governmental agencies and itscontractors for a period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction may materially and adversely aﬀect our operating results or reputation.
From time to time we receive grants from governments, agencies and research organizations, or enter into tax arrangements. If we are unable to comply with the terms ofthose grants or arrangements, we may not be able to receive or recognize beneﬁts or we may be required to repay beneﬁts, recognize related charges, or could berequired to implement
50
Table of Contents
certain limitations on our business, which would adversely aﬀect our operating results and ﬁnancial position.
From time to time, we have received, and may in the future receive, economic incentive grants, tax beneﬁts, and allowances from national, state and local governments,agencies and research organizations targeted at increasing employment, production or investment at speciﬁc locations. Tax arrangements and subsidy grant agreements typicallycontain economic incentive, headcount, capital and research and development expenditures and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain beneﬁts, and theseprograms can be subjected to periodic review by the relevant governments. Regulations associated with government grants may contain certain restrictions on grant recipienttechnology licensing activities and the expansion of certain facilities. Compliance with these restrictions could add complexity to our operations and increase our costs. Inaddition, noncompliance with the conditions of the grants or arrangements could result in our forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as therepayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date. We may be unable to obtain future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operatingcosts, without which our cost structure would be adversely impacted. Further, any decrease in amounts received could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results ofoperations, or ﬁnancial condition.
We may not fully realize the anticipated beneﬁts of our completed or future acquisitions or divestitures.
We have acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, additional businesses that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses. Integration of ouracquisitions is complex and may be costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. We may not successfully or proﬁtably integrate, operate,maintain and manage any newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, procedures and policies. We may not realize the expectedsynergies and cost savings from the integration. There may be increased risk due to integrating ﬁnancial reporting and internal control systems. It may be diﬃcult to develop,manufacture and market the products of a newly acquired company, or grow the business at the rate we anticipate. There may be increased risk associated with the activities ofthe acquired company such as regulatory violations related to their use of AI in their operations, technology development or product oﬀerings or cyber security risks. Following anacquisition, we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition. We may suﬀer loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquiredcompanies and it may be diﬃcult to implement our corporate culture at acquired companies. We have been and may in the future be subject to claims from terminatedemployees, stockholders of Microchip or the acquired companies and other third parties related to the transaction. In particular, in connection with our Microsemi and Atmelacquisitions, we became involved with third-party claims, litigation, governmental investigations and disputes related to such businesses and transactions. Acquisitions may alsoresult in charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-oﬀs, restructuring charges, or future impairment of goodwill), contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences,additional share-based compensation expense and other charges that adversely aﬀect our operating results. We may fund future acquisitions of new businesses or strategicalliances by utilizing cash, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, issuing Commercial Paper, raising debt, issuing shares of our common stock, or other mechanisms.
Further, if we decide to divest assets or a business, it may be diﬃcult to ﬁnd or complete divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies, which may include siteclosures, timely or on acceptable terms. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to thedesired divestiture, or the price or terms of the divestiture may be less favorable than we had anticipated. Even following a divestiture or other exit strategy, we may have certaincontinuing obligations to former employees, customers, vendors, landlords or other third parties. We may also have continuing liabilities related to former employees, assets orbusinesses. Such obligations may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
In addition to acquisitions, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to enter into joint development agreements or other strategic relationships with other companies.These transactions are subject to a number of risks similar to those we face with our acquisitions including our ability to realize the expected beneﬁts of any such transaction, tosuccessfully market and sell products resulting from such transactions or to successfully integrate any technology developed through such transactions.
As a result of our acquisition activity our goodwill and intangible assets increased signiﬁcantly and we may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or intangibleassets.
When we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identiﬁable intangible assets. The amount of thepurchase price which is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identiﬁable assets acquired. As of September 30, 2025, we hadgoodwill of $6.70 billion and net intangible assets of $2.17 billion. We review our indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment annually in the fourth ﬁscalquarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
51
Table of Contents
amount of those assets is more likely than not impaired.  Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline inour stock price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash ﬂows and slower growth rates in our industry.  Our valuation methodology for assessing impairmentrequires management to make judgments and assumptions based on experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance.  Because we operate in highlycompetitive environments, projections of our future operating results and cash ﬂows may vary signiﬁcantly from our actual results.  Through September 30, 2025, we have neverrecorded a goodwill impairment charge. There were no material intangible asset impairment charges in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026. If in future periods, we determine thatour goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets which would have a negative eﬀect on our condensed consolidated ﬁnancialstatements.
If we fail to maintain proper and eﬀective internal control and remediate any future control deﬁciencies, our ability to produce accurate and timely ﬁnancial statementscould be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation with investors.
We have in the past identiﬁed a material weakness in our internal controls related to accounting for income taxes and we also identiﬁed a material weakness in our internalcontrols related to IT system access. Although such material weaknesses were remediated in ﬁscal 2020, there can be no assurance that similar control issues will not be identiﬁedin the future. If we cannot remediate future material weaknesses or signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in a timely manner, or if we identify additional control deﬁciencies that individually ortogether constitute signiﬁcant deﬁciencies or material weaknesses, our ability to accurately record, process, and report ﬁnancial information and our ability to prepare ﬁnancialstatements within required time periods, could be adversely aﬀected. Failure to maintain eﬀective internal controls could result in violations of applicable securities laws, stockexchange listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt agreements, subject us to litigation and investigations, negatively aﬀect investor conﬁdence in our ﬁnancialstatements, and adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets.
Ensuring that we have adequate internal ﬁnancial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate ﬁnancial statements on a timely basis is a costlyand time-consuming eﬀort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Actof 2002 which requires an annual management assessment of the eﬀectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and a report by our independent auditors. Inaddition to the identiﬁed material weaknesses related to accounting for income taxes and to IT system access, which were remediated as of March 31, 2020, we have from time totime identiﬁed other signiﬁcant deﬁciencies. If we fail to remediate any future material weaknesses or signiﬁcant deﬁciencies or to maintain proper and eﬀective internal controlover ﬁnancial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely ﬁnancial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our abilityto operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.
Customer demands for us to implement business practices that are more stringent than legal requirements may reduce our revenue opportunities or cause us to incurhigher costs.
Some of our customers require that we implement practices that are more stringent than those required by applicable laws with respect to labor requirements, the materialscontained in our products, energy eﬃciency, environmental impact or other items. To comply with such requirements, we may require our suppliers to adopt such practices. Oursuppliers may in the future refuse to implement these practices, or may charge us more for complying with them. If certain of our suppliers refuse to implement the practices, wemay be forced to source from alternate suppliers. The cost to implement such practices may cause us to incur higher costs and reduce our proﬁtability, and if we do notimplement such practices, such customers may disqualify us as a supplier, resulting in decreased revenue opportunities. Developing, enforcing, and auditing customer-requestedpractices at our own sites and in our supply chain will increase our costs and may require more personnel.
We must attract and retain qualiﬁed personnel to be successful, and competition for qualiﬁed personnel has intensiﬁed.
We must attract and retain qualiﬁed personnel to be successful, and competition for qualiﬁed personnel and available labor may intensify for a variety of reasons, includingthe increase in work-from-home arrangements, the wage inﬂation in our industry, and the demand for employees with expertise in developing ﬁelds such as AI.
Our business relies on the ability to attract and retain skilled employees across various functions, including management, technical, marketing, sales, research anddevelopment, manufacturing, and operations. Our failure to attract and retain hardware and software engineers, as well as sales and marketing personnel, could delay productdevelopment and
52
Table of Contents
introduction, thereby adversely aﬀecting our net sales. We depend on a direct labor force at our manufacturing facilities, and any inability to maintain this workforce couldadversely aﬀect our operations. This could lead to delays in production and shipments, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, and ultimately adversely impact our business,ﬁnancial condition, and operational results. As the integration of AI becomes more prevalent, there is an anticipated shift in the skills required within the workforce, making AIliteracy increasingly important for our employees. Competition for personnel with AI expertise may be intense and costly.
In the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2025, we implemented a global reduction of our work force, which we completed in the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2026. That reduction in force mayhave negatively aﬀected employee morale and could diminish our attractiveness as an employer. If we lose existing qualiﬁed personnel or are unable to hire new qualiﬁedpersonnel, as needed, it could impair our ability to compete eﬀectively.
Furthermore, changes in immigration laws and regulations, or more robust enforcement of new or existing laws, may hinder our ability to attract and retain qualiﬁedengineering personnel. In the U.S., where a portion of our research and development teams are based, stricter immigration controls could adversely aﬀect the employment statusof non-U.S. engineers and other key technical employees, as well as our ability to hire new non-U.S. employees. U.S. immigration policies may also make it more challenging torecruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates from U.S. universities.
Our success depends on the contributions of our senior management team. We have experienced transitions with respect to certain members of our senior management dueto retirements or other reasons in the past and may do so in the future. Eﬀective succession planning is important for our long-term success and we have a program designed toaddress this risk. Because we have no employment agreements with our U.S. senior management team, they could leave with little or no notice, which could make it more diﬃcultfor us to execute our planned business strategy. The inability to ﬁnd suitable replacements for senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy andrespond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.
The occurrence of events for which we are self-insured, or which exceed our insurance limits, may adversely aﬀect our proﬁtability and liquidity.
We have insurance coverage related to many diﬀerent types of risk; however, we self-insure for some potentially signiﬁcant risks and obligations, because we believe that it ismore cost eﬀective for us to self-insure than to pay the high premium costs. The risks and exposures that we self-insure include, but are not limited to, employee health matters,certain property matters, product defects, cybersecurity matters, employment risks, environmental matters, political risks, and intellectual property matters. Should there be a lossor adverse judgment in an area for which we are self-insured, then our ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely aﬀected.
Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Products, Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Litigation
We continue to be the target of attacks on our IT systems. Interruptions in and unauthorized access to our IT systems, security breaches or incidents impacting our systemsor data that we or our service providers maintain or otherwise process including data belonging to us, or our customers, suppliers, contractors or employees, couldadversely aﬀect our business.
We rely on the uninterrupted operation of complex IT systems and networks to operate our business.  Any improper handling of conﬁdential data, or signiﬁcant disruption toour systems or networks, including, but not limited to, any that may relate to new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches or incidents, cyber-attacks,ransom-style attacks, theft or tampering, inadvertent error, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts, security breaches orincidents in our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, in third-party products we use, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, or any data we or ourservice providers maintain or otherwise process, including but not limited to, data belonging to us or our customers, suppliers, contractors or employees, or any perception any ofthe foregoing has occurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, supply chain, sales and operating results, result in regulatory inquiries,investigations or other proceedings against us, result in claims, demands and litigation against us, or damage our reputation.  Such improper handling of conﬁdential data, orsystem or network disruption, or any cyber-attack or other means of eﬀectuating a security breach or incident, could result in loss or unavailability of all or a portion of oursystems and business operations, and a loss, unavailability, an unauthorized release of, or other unauthorized use or processing of, personal data, or our suppliers’ or ourcustomers’ intellectual property or conﬁdential, proprietary or sensitive information. Any such matter, or any perception that it has occurred, could harm our business orcompetitive position, result in a loss of customer conﬁdence, and cause us to incur signiﬁcant costs to remedy the damages, and may result in lower revenue, lower margins,regulatory investigations, inquiries or other proceedings,

enforcement actions, remediation obligations, claims for damages, litigation, and ﬁnes, penalties, damages, other liabilities, and other sanctions.
We have experienced and continue to experience veriﬁable attacks on our IT systems and data, including network compromises, attempts to breach our security measuresand attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems. For example, in August 2024, we determined that an unauthorized party disrupted our use of certain servers
and some of our business operations. As a result, certain of our manufacturing facilities were operating at less than normal levels for a period of time, and our ability to fulﬁllorders was temporarily impacted. While we were able to bring the aﬀected portions of our IT systems back online and restore normal business operations in response to thisAugust 2024 incident without a material impact to our business, we cannot be certain that we would be able to achieve this result in the event of another cyber-attack. Weroutinely evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the containment mechanisms that we have implemented and continue to implement additional measures. We analyzed the informationthat was compromised in August 2024 and we do not believe that this cyber incident has had a material adverse eﬀect on our business or resulted in any material damage to us.New information can develop that may impact our assessment of cyber events, including information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations.
Due to the types of products we sell and the signiﬁcant amount of sales we make to government agencies or customers whose principal sales are to U.S. governmentagencies, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience in the future, attacks on our IT systems and data, including attempts to breach our security, networkcompromises and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems. Geopolitical events and tensions may increase these risks. Also, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could use AI and machine learning to enhance attack methods, develop malicious code, sophisticated phishing attempts, and convincing deep fakes. A deep fake is amanipulation of our content or the voices or images of our leaders to maliciously publish false messages that appear to be authentic. Such messages may harm our reputation,which may in turn have an adverse impact on our revenue and proﬁts, and reduce the trading price of our stock. A threat could also be introduced by our or our customers' andbusiness partners' use of AI tools. The output of these tools may include threats such as introducing malicious code when AI generated source code is incorporated into productsor systems. Were any future attacks to be successful, or through the unintentional introduction of security vulnerability due to AI usage, we may be unaware of the incident, itsmagnitude, or its eﬀects until signiﬁcant harm is done. More generally, we may face signiﬁcant delays in identifying, remediating, and otherwise responding to any interruption,disruption, security breach or incident.
In recent years, we have regularly implemented improvements to our protective measures that have included, but have not been limited to, implementation of the following:ﬁrewalls, endpoint intrusion detection and response software, regular vulnerability scanning and risk-based remediation, automated patching, log monitors, AI-assisted eventcorrelation tools, network segmentation, routine backups with oﬀsite retention of storage media, system audits, dual factor identiﬁcation, data partitioning and encryption,privileged account segregation and monitoring, routine password modiﬁcations, and an enhanced information security program including training classes and phishing exercisesfor employees and contractors with system access, along with tabletop exercises conducted by information security personnel. However, our system improvements have not beenfully eﬀective in preventing attacks on our IT systems and data, including breaches of our security measures, and there can be no assurance that any future system improvementswill be eﬀective in preventing cyber-attacks or disruptions, a ransom-style attack, or limiting the damage from any cyber-attacks or disruptions. Our ability to recover fromransomware and other ransom-style attacks may be limited if our backups have been aﬀected by the attack, or if restoring data from backups is delayed or not feasible. Oursystem improvements have resulted in increased costs to us and we may be required to dedicate additional expenditures and resources to making system improvements andotherwise addressing cybersecurity matters in the future, whether in response to any disruption, interruption, breach, incident or otherwise. Further, any future improvements,attacks or disruptions could result in additional costs related to rebuilding our internal systems, defending litigation, complaints or other claims, providing notices to regulatoryagencies or other third parties, responding to regulatory inquiries, actions or other proceedings, or paying damages, ﬁnes or penalties. Such attacks or disruptions could have amaterial adverse impact on our business, operations and ﬁnancial results. Furthermore, our eﬀorts to comply with evolving laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, such asSEC rules requiring disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident, may be costly and any actual or alleged failure to comply could result in investigations, proceedings, investorlawsuits and reputational damage.
In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees, or other third parties,including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, wrongfully use, publish, access, process or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or otherthird parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property, or other proprietary or conﬁdential information. This risk would be exacerbated to the extent ourcompetitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, hire our employees. Similarly,
54
Table of Contents
we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property, and other proprietary or conﬁdential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees andcertain of our consultants, who may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property orinformation to third parties, including our competitors or state actors.
Third-party service providers, such as wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors, credit card processors, and other vendors have access to portions of ourand our customers' data. These service providers also face signiﬁcant cybersecurity threats, and they may be subject to cyber-attacks, disruptions, and interruptions to theirnetworks and systems, and otherwise may suﬀer from security breaches and incidents. Any such breach or incident, including any involving misappropriation, loss or otherunauthorized processing of data maintained or otherwise processed by our third-party service providers, or any perception any of these has occurred, could negatively impact ourbusiness, operations and ﬁnancial results, as well as our relationship with our customers.
Our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are suﬃcient to protect usfrom liabilities, damages, or claims related to our cybersecurity practices or measures. We do not have insurance coverage speciﬁcally for cybersecurity matters. Insurancecoverage that we do have may not be adequate or suﬃcient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our cybersecurity practices or measures or otherwise relatingto any cybersecurity breach or incident, and we cannot be sure that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coveragewill pay future claims.
We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.
Our products, or IP that we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard speciﬁcations that we implement in our products, maybe subject to security vulnerabilities. And, while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third-party content or user-generated data stored onour products, these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised, breached, or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers. Ourproducts are being used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity, privacy or safety risks including applications that gather and process data, such as thecloud or Internet of Things, automotive applications, and applications that use AI. We, our customers, and the users of our products may not promptly learn of or have the abilityto fully assess the magnitude or eﬀects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Additionally, new information can develop thatmay impact our assessment of a security vulnerability, including information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations, or become aware of additional variants or evaluate thecompetitiveness of products.
Security vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse eﬀects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely aﬀect our results of operations, ﬁnancial condition, sales,customer relationships, share price, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigationscould damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. These eﬀects may be greater to the extent that competing products arenot susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more eﬀectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regardingpotential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available. This, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits of vulnerabilities, adversely aﬀect our abilityto introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation.
We face risks to our business and proprietary conﬁdential information due to use of AI.
We limit our employees’ use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, in accordance with our internal guidelines and procedures. However, the internal governance of the use of thesetechnologies can be challenging, and our employees and consultants may use these tools on an unauthorized basis and our partners may use these tools, which poses additionalrisks relating to the protection of data, including the potential exposure of our proprietary conﬁdential or other controlled information to unauthorized recipients and the misuseof our or third-party intellectual property. Use of AI tools may result in allegations or claims against us related to violation of third-party intellectual property rights, unauthorizedaccess to or use of proprietary information, failure to comply with open-source software requirements, and failure to comply with actual or asserted legal or other obligations. AItools may also produce inaccurate or biased responses that could lead to errors in our decision-making, product development or other business activities, which could have anegative impact on our business, operating results and ﬁnancial condition. Our ability to mitigate these risks will depend on our continued eﬀective maintaining, training,monitoring and enforcement of appropriate guidelines and procedures governing the use of AI tools, and the results of any such use, by us or our partners.

Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or ﬁnancial harm and liability.
Diﬀering opinions and regulations regarding what constitutes the responsible use of technologies, including new and evolving technologies such as AI, in our internaloperations and in our products and services may result in reputational or ﬁnancial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. AI introduces newlegal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could aﬀect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or oﬀer solutions that draw controversydue to their perceived or actual societal impact, such as AI solutions with unintended consequences, infringement of copyright or rights of publicity, or those that raise concernsrelated to human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to maintain eﬀective internal policies and frameworks relating to theresponsible development and use of AI enabling products in this emerging and rapidly changing area, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legalliability. Adhering to AI-related regulations across various jurisdictions related to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may require changes to the way we operate incertain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to use AI in our internal operations or oﬀer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply withregulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including federal and state regulations in the U.S and regulations in jurisdictions such as the EU,may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. New and updated AI regulations could imposeonerous obligations that may disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our ﬁnancial results.
Our failure to comply with federal, state, or international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and handling, and cybersecurity may materiallyadversely aﬀect our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally regarding privacy, data protection and handling, and cybersecurity, such as the EuropeanUnion’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K. equivalent to the GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California PrivacyRights Act (CPRA), the EU Cyber Resilience Act and Cybersecurity Act, and the Cybersecurity Maturity Model. The scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving, subject todiﬀering interpretations, and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Some of these laws create a broad deﬁnition of personal information, establish data privacy rights, imposedata breach notiﬁcation requirements, and create potentially severe statutory damages or other remedial frameworks and private rights of action for certain data breaches. Someof the laws and regulations also place restrictions on our ability to collect, store, use, transmit and process personal information and other data across our business. For example,the GDPR restricts the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. and other countries. Some of these laws mandate data-handling and cybersecurity requirements, conformity assessments and incident reporting such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model. Over time, failure to comply withCybersecurity Maturity Model levels required by the U.S. Department of Defense and its prime customers may make us ineligible for government contracts. Such laws andregulations have resulted and will continue to result in signiﬁcantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies such as us that have employees, customers, andoperations in the EEA or make sales into government-related projects.
We have relied mainly on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), for transfers of personal information from the EEA to the U.S. or other countries.However, the Court of Justice of the EU in a July 2020 decision (Schrems II) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield) and also called for stricter conditionsin the use of the SCCs. Following the Schrems II decision, certain data protection authorities in the EU have issued statements advising companies within their jurisdiction not totransfer personal data to the U.S. under the SCCs. The EU and U.S. have established a successor framework to the Privacy Shield, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S.DPF), but it already has faced a legal challenge and may face additional legal challenges. If we are unable to implement suﬃcient safeguards to ensure that our transfers ofpersonal information from the EEA are lawful, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions and substantial ﬁnes and injunctions against processing personal informationfrom the EEA. The loss of our ability to lawfully transfer personal data out of the EEA may cause reluctance or refusal by European customers to communicate with us as they arecurrently, and we may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in the EEA at signiﬁcant expense. Additionally, other countries outside of the EEA have passed or areconsidering passing laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of providing our products in those jurisdictions.
Furthermore, the GDPR and the U.K. equivalent of the GDPR expose us to two parallel data protection regimes in Europe, each of which potentially authorizes ﬁnes andenforcement actions for certain violations. Substantial ﬁnes may be imposed for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to 4% of a company’s worldwiderevenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personaldata. Although the U.K. data protection regime currently permits data transfers from the U.K. to the EEA and other third countries, covered by a European Commission 'adequacydecision' through the continued use of SCCs and binding corporate rules, these laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could have adverse
56
Table of Contents
implications for our transfer of personal data from the U.K. to the EEA and other third countries. Additionally, new and updated AI regulations could impose onerous obligationsthat may disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices.
In the U.S., federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and handling, and cybersecurity. Forexample, California has enacted the CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as deﬁned in the law) and places increased privacy and securityobligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CPRA, which became operative January 1, 2023, expands the CCPA’s requirements, includingapplying to personal information of business representatives and employees and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. Additionally, numerousother states have proposed or enacted laws addressing privacy and security, many of which impose obligations similar to those of the CCPA. The U.S. federal government also haslaws regarding handling of government-regulated data (e.g., controlled unclassiﬁed information, classiﬁed data, export-controlled data) and is contemplating federal privacylegislation. The CCPA, and other evolving legislation relating to privacy, data protection, and information security may impact our business activities and require us to modify ourpolicies and practices.
If other jurisdictions enact similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, it would increase the cost and complexity of doing businessand non-compliance could result in ﬁnes or other sanctions from regulators. The inability to transfer personal data to the U.S. could signiﬁcantly and negatively impact ourbusiness operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal dataprocessing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at signiﬁcant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe forallegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.
While we continue to undertake eﬀorts to conform to current legal and regulatory obligations and to account for relevant best practices, such eﬀorts may be unsuccessful orresult in signiﬁcant costs. We may also experience reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to provide us with personal data due to the potentialrisk exposure of personal data transfers and the current data protection obligations imposed on them by applicable data protection laws or by certain data protection authorities.These and any other laws relating to privacy or data protection and handling and their interpretations continue to develop and their uncertainty and inconsistency may increasethe cost of compliance, cause compliance challenges, restrict our ability to oﬀer products in certain locations in the same way that we have been, and potentially adversely aﬀectcertain third-party service providers. Further, any actual or alleged failure by us or our service providers to comply with laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted obligationsrelating to privacy, data protection and handling, or cybersecurity may subject us to claims, demands, and litigation, sanctions or ﬁnes by regulators, and other damages andliabilities. Any of the foregoing may harm our reputation and market position and otherwise could adversely aﬀect our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, investigations or claims.
We are currently, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings, investigations or claims regarding intellectual property rights, product defects, breach of contracts,export controls and sanctions, and other matters. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notiﬁcations from third parties from time to time who believe that weowe them indemniﬁcation or other obligations related to claims made against us, our direct or indirect customers, or our licensees. These legal proceedings and claims, even ifmeritless, have in the past and could in the future result in unexpected and substantial costs to us. If we are unable to resolve or settle a matter, obtain necessary licenses onreasonable terms, reengineer products or processes to avoid infringement, provide a cost-eﬀective remedy, or successfully prosecute or defend our position, we could incuruninsured liability in any of them, be required to take a charge to operations, be enjoined from selling a material portion of our products or using certain processes, suﬀer areduction or elimination in the value of our inventories, incur reputational damage, and our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations could be harmed.
It is also possible that from time to time we may be subject to claims related to the manufacture, performance, or use of our products. These claims may be due to injuries,economic damage, lost intellectual property, or environmental exposures related to manufacturing, a product's nonconformance to our or our customer’s speciﬁcations, changesin our manufacturing processes, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected customer system issues due to the integration of our products or insuﬃcient design or testing by ourcustomers. We could incur signiﬁcant expenses related to such matters, including, but not limited to:
• costs related to writing oﬀ the value of our inventory of nonconforming products;• recalling nonconforming products;• providing support services, product replacements, or modiﬁcations to products and the defense of such claims;
57
Table of Contents
• diversion of resources from other projects;• lost revenue or a delay in the recognition of revenue due to cancellation of orders, unpaid receivables, or reimbursement of costs or damages;• customer imposed ﬁnes or penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements; and• a requirement to pay damages, penalties or recall costs.
Because the systems into which our products are integrated have a higher cost of goods than the products we sell, the expenses and damages we are asked to pay may besigniﬁcantly higher than the revenue and proﬁts we received. While we exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, certain of our contracts do notexclude such liabilities. Further, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by law. We have liability insurance which covers certain damages arising out of product defects,but we do not expect that insurance will fully protect against such claims. Payments we may make in connection with these customer claims may adversely aﬀect the results ofour operations.
Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive, aerospace, defense, safety, security, and medical, where failure of the application could cause damage toproperty or persons. We may be subject to claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. We will face increased exposure to claims if there aresubstantial increases in either the volume of our sales into these applications or the frequency of system failures integrating our products.
Our contractual relationships with our customers expose us to risks and liabilities.
We do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our non-distributor customers, and therefore we cannot be certain about future order levels from our customers.Further, except for a few LTSAs that are still in place, the customer contracts that we enter into generally do not require any speciﬁed level of purchases and allow customers tocancel orders or terminate the contract with limited restrictions. Under our LTSAs, customers may cancel orders in the event of price increases. While we had approximately101,000 customers, and our ten largest direct customers accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue in the ﬁrst six months of ﬁscal 2026, and two of our top ten directcustomers are contract manufacturers that perform manufacturing services for many customers, cancellation of customer contracts could have an adverse impact on our revenueand proﬁts. For example, due to uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an increase in order cancellations and requests to reschedule deliveries to futuredates in the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2021. Also, many of our customers felt the eﬀects of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty, and customer requests topush-out or cancel backlog and our accommodation of their requests increased in the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2023 and continued in ﬁscal 2024 and the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2025.
Certain customer contracts diﬀer from our standard terms of sale due to the negotiating leverage held by the customer. For example, under certain contracts we havecommitted to supply products on scheduled delivery dates, or extended our obligations for liabilities such as warranties or indemniﬁcation for quality issues or intellectualproperty infringement. If we are unable to supply the customer as contractually required, the customer may incur additional production costs, lost revenues due to delays in theirmanufacturing schedule, or quality-related issues. We may be liable for costs and damages associated with customer claims, and we may be obligated to defend the customeragainst claims of intellectual property infringement and pay associated legal fees. While we try to minimize the number of contracts which contain such provisions, manage therisks of such liabilities, and set caps on our liability exposure, sometimes we are unable to do so. In order to win important designs, avoid losing business to competitors, maintainexisting business, or be permitted to bid on new business, we have, and may in the future, have to agree to uncapped liability for such items as intellectual property infringementor product failure, or have to agree to liquidated damage provisions. This exposes us to risk of liability far exceeding the purchase price of the products sold under such contracts,the lifetime revenues we receive under such contracts, or potential consequential damages. Further, where we do not have negotiated customer contracts, our customer's orderterms may govern the transaction and contain terms unfavorable to us. These risks could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could result in competitive harm, lost revenue or market opportunities.
Our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes is important for our success. To that end, wehave acquired certain patents and licenses and intend to continue to seek patents on our technology and manufacturing processes. The process of seeking patent protection canbe expensive, and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications. In addition, our existing and new patents, trademarks and copyrights that are issuedmay not have suﬃcient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to, or may initiate, interference proceedings in theU.S. Patent and Trademark Oﬃce, patent oﬃces of a foreign country or U.S. or foreign courts, which can require signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
58

resources. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Infringement of ourintellectual property rights by a third-party could result in harm to our competitive position, uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for us. Although we continueto aggressively defend and protect our intellectual property on a worldwide basis, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.
Certain of our software is derived from “open source” software that is generally made available to the public by its authors. Certain of the software of our suppliers andcustomers may also be derived from open source software. Open source software licenses impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works ofthe open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under aparticular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use to protect our intellectual property. While we believe we have complied with our obligations underthe various applicable licenses for open source software, in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to legally establish that we had not compliedwith the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work if the license isterminated which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
Governments and courts are considering new issues in intellectual property law with respect to works created by AI technology, which could result in changing andinconsistent intellectual property rights in development processes, procedures and technologies we create with AI technology, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on ourbusiness.
Risks Related to Taxation, Laws and Regulations
Our reported ﬁnancial results may be adversely aﬀected by new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices.
We prepare our ﬁnancial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the FASB and the SEC. Newaccounting pronouncements and interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future. New accountingpronouncements or a change in the interpretation of accounting standards or practices may have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on our reported ﬁnancial results and may aﬀect our reportingof transactions completed before the change is eﬀective.
Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into or from which we ship our products or import supplies could issue new export controls or trade sanctions, levy ﬁnes, restrict ordelay our ability to export products or import supplies, or increase costs associated with the manufacture or transfer of products.
A signiﬁcant portion of our sales involve export and import activities. Our U.S.-manufactured products or products based on U.S. technology or U.S. software, or productsincorporating U.S. content may be subject to laws and regulations administrated by various agencies including those under the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce, andTreasury, that govern international trade, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Export Administration Regulations (EAR), International Traﬃc in ArmsRegulations, economic embargoes and tariﬀs or other trade sanctions against certain countries and parties. Licenses or license exceptions are often required for the shipment ofour products to certain countries as well as for releases of our technology and software to foreign nationals. Our inability to timely obtain a license, for any reason, not limited to adelay in license processing due to a federal government shutdown, or changes in government policies of approval or denial of licenses, could cause a delay in scheduled shipmentswhich could have a material adverse impact on our revenue within the quarter of a shutdown, and in following quarters depending on the extent that license processing isdelayed. Further, determination by a government that we have failed to comply with trade regulations or anti-bribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denialof export privileges, ﬁnes, penalties, and seizure of products, or loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, sales and earnings. A changein laws and regulations could restrict our ability to transfer product to previously permitted countries, customers, distributors or others. For example, in October 2022, the U.S.Commerce Department published a regulation that imposed restrictions on activities in or involving China, Hong Kong, and Macau related to advanced computing integratedcircuits (ICs), advanced-node ICs, computers and other commodities that contain such ICs, certain semiconductor manufacturing items, and supercomputers. The regulation alsoexpanded controls on transactions involving semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor equipment manufacturing end-uses. Further, this regulation and others expandedthe scope of foreign-produced items subject to license requirements under U.S. law. In November 2023, the U.S. Commerce Department added restrictions and export licenserequirements to end uses and product categories previously described in the October 2022 regulation. To date, the U.S. Commerce Department has issued a number ofregulations that further restrict transactions involving semiconductors and related products. In addition, the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State, and Treasury have beenadding parties to the restricted parties lists, and imposing prohibitions and export licensing requirements on transactions with them. The result of
59
Table of Contents
these additional restrictions and the change in the U.S. Administration in 2025 is that there has been a slow-down in the processing of export license applications by the U.S.Government and an increased burden on us to conduct additional due diligence imposed by the regulations, as well as by sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine. Atthis time, there has not been a material impact on our ability to obtain necessary licenses for exportation. A previous example occurred in ﬁscal 2020, when the U.S. CommerceDepartment eﬀectively banned U.S. companies from selling products or transferring technology to certain Chinese companies, including Huawei and their related companiesworldwide. In ﬁscal 2020, the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation prohibited U.S. governmental agencies from buying equipment incorporating covered telecommunicationsequipment, as a substantial component or critical technology, where the technology came from certain Chinese companies. In July 2020, this was expanded to prohibit U.S.governmental agencies from entering into a contract with any company that uses covered telecommunications equipment whether or not the Chinese technology is related to theprocurement. Since then, similar restrictions have been imposed under the National Defense and Authorization Act when supply chain includes certain Chinese entities. The EARalso eﬀectively prohibits sales of items for a “military end use,” to a "military end-user," or for a "military intelligence" end-user, or end-use to certain countries, such as Belarus,Burma, Cambodia, Cuba, China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria and Venezuela. Any of the foregoing changes to the regulatory requirements could adversely impact ouroperational costs due to the administrative impacts of complying with these regulations and may limit those with whom we conduct business. Any one or more of these sanctions,future sanctions, a change in laws or regulations, or a prohibition on shipment of our products or transfer of our technology to signiﬁcant customers could have a material adverseeﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
The U.S. and other countries have levied tariﬀs and taxes on certain goods, implemented trade restrictions, and introduced national security protection policies. Tradetensions between the U.S. and China, have continued to escalate from 2018 to present, and include the U.S. increasing tariﬀs on Chinese origin goods and China increasing tariﬀson U.S. origin goods. Additionally, the U.S has imposed a baseline 10% tariﬀ on almost all imported goods globally. We continue to take steps to mitigate the costs of these tariﬀson our business by adjusting our operations and supply chain, but may be unable to completely mitigate the costs of such tariﬀs, including those imposed thus far in 2025 or in thefuture.
On August 1, 2025, the U.S. Administration implemented additional changes to its tariﬀ policy, including the suspension of the de minimis exemption, expiration of the 10%baseline tariﬀ, implementation of revised reciprocal tariﬀs tailored to each trading partner, and the imposition of tariﬀs on particular goods (e.g., copper). Althoughsemiconductors remain exempt from most of the recent tariﬀ actions, an increase in tariﬀs on semiconductors is expected to be imposed once the Section 232 investigation intothe impact on U.S. national security by imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and their derivative products is concluded. Semiconductors may alsobe subject to tariﬀs resulting from ongoing trade negotiations. Increased tariﬀs on our customers' products could adversely impact their sales, and increased tariﬀs on ourproducts in comparison to those of our competitors could each result in lower demand for our products. Further, governments may impose restrictions on the sale to certaincustomers of our products, or any applications containing our products. For example, the Chinese government has announced restrictions relating to sales of certain raw materialsand to sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, and they may direct companies within China to purchase Chinese-made products. The Chinese governmentalso initiated an antidumping investigation into imports of analog chips originating in the United States, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue if additional tariﬀs areimposed by the Chinese government on products subject to the investigation. Similar restrictions on our products or the products of our customers or suppliers could negativelyimpact our business and ﬁnancial results. It is also possible that evolving U.S. export controls may encourage our non-U.S. customers to purchase from companies not subject toU.S. export controls, thereby harming our business, market position, and ﬁnancial results. Excessive export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductorproducts, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls mayincrease investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
Further changes in trade or national security protection policy, tariﬀs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, including those taken against the U.S. inretaliation for U.S. policies, may limit our ability to obtain equipment, components or raw materials (including rare earth minerals), limit our ability to produce products, increaseour selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, reduce our ability to sell products, or reduce our ability to have mergersand acquisitions approved by governmental agencies, any of which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations or ﬁnancial conditions.
The outcome of future examinations of our income tax returns and existing tax disputes could have an adverse eﬀect on our results of operations.
We are subject to examination of our U.S. and certain foreign income tax returns for ﬁscal 2007 and later. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes of theseexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from current or future examinations. There can be no assurance that the ﬁnal determination of any of these or anyfuture examinations will not have an adverse eﬀect on our eﬀective tax rates, ﬁnancial position and results of operations.
In September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deﬁciency (2007 to 2012 Notice) from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for ﬁscal 2007 through ﬁscal2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2021, we ﬁled a petition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2007 to 2012 Notice. InSeptember 2023, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the IRS for ﬁscal 2013 and ﬁscal 2016. In October 2023, we received a Statutory Notice of Deﬁciency (2014 to2015 Notice) from the IRS for ﬁscal 2014 and ﬁscal 2015. The disputed amounts for ﬁscal 2013 to ﬁscal 2016 largely relate to transfer pricing matters. In December 2023, we ﬁled apetition in the U.S. Tax Court challenging the 2014 to 2015 Notice. In September 2025, we reached a settlement with the IRS for ﬁscal 2007 to ﬁscal 2015.
In May 2023, we received a proposed income adjustment from the Malaysian Inland Revenue Board (IRB) for ﬁscal 2020. In December 2023, we received a Notice ofAssessment from the IRB asserting the same proposed income adjustment. In March 2025, we entered into a Consent Judgment before the High Court, agreeing that the disputewill be heard before the Special Commissioners of Income Tax (SCIT). It was also agreed that the payment on the taxes assessed is stayed and the IRB will pause all enforcementand proceedings against the collection of the taxes assessed until the appeal before the SCIT is concluded. If the adjustment is upheld by the highest court that has jurisdictionover this matter in Malaysia, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $410.0 million. The disputed amounts largely relate to the characterization of certain assets. Thetiming of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but could occur in the next 12 months.
In January 2025, we received several assessments from the German Tax Authorities (GTA) regarding the German extraterritorial taxation of royalty payments betweennonresidents (referred to as oﬀshore receipts in respect of intangible property or ORIP) and intellectual property transfers by nonresidents (referred to as extraterritorial capitalgains taxation or ETT). If the assessment is upheld, it could result in income taxes and penalties up to $92.0 million. The timing of adjudicating this matter is uncertain but couldoccur in the next 12 months.
The ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRB or GTA were to prevail on their assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deﬁciency interestcould have a material adverse impact on our ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
Exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities, changes in tax rates, laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations, orunfavorable assessments from tax audits and examinations could aﬀect our eﬀective tax rates, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax obligations could be aﬀected by many factors, includingchanges to our operating structure, intercompany arrangements and tax planning strategies.
Our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective ﬁnancial period. Our future eﬀective tax rates, ﬁnancial condition and results fromoperations could be unfavorably aﬀected by several factors. These include changes in tax rates, tax laws, and tax regulations and how those laws are interpreted in jurisdictionswhere our income is earned. This also applies to jurisdictions that align with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion Proﬁt Shiftingrecommendations. Other risks include changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets and changes in where we earn our income geographically. We may also face challengesfrom tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing agreements. Additional risks include not meeting performance obligations with respect to tax incentiveagreements, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously ﬁled tax returns.
Our business, ﬁnancial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted by policies implemented globally by the current or future administrations.
The U.S. and certain other global jurisdictions in which we operate, have taken and have threatened to take signiﬁcant legislative and policy changes in areas including but notlimited to tariﬀs, taxes and trade, labor, and the environment. If implemented, these changes could increase our eﬀective tax rate, decrease our revenue and increase our selling,general, administrative and/or manufacturing costs, which could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations or ﬁnancial conditions. Changes in tariﬀs, taxpolicy, trade regulations or other matters, and any uncertainty surrounding the scope or timing of such changes, could negatively impact the stock market, and reduce the tradingprice of our stock or

otherwise impact our business. For example, in February 2022, the U.S. began implementing widescale sanctions against Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sanctionsagainst Belarus and certain Ukrainian regions were later implemented. Because the actions by Russia against Ukraine are in conﬂict with our Guiding Values, we chose to ceaseshipments into Russia and Belarus, and we will continue to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia, Belarus, and Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine. While salesof our products into these regions, and to customers that sell into these regions, have been negatively impacted, at this time, we have not experienced a material adverse impacton our revenue. Retaliatory acts by Russia in response to the sanctions could include cyber-attacks, sanctions, or other actions that could disrupt the U.S. economy. As a result ofthe foregoing risks or similar risks, the imposition of sanctions could have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, results of operations or ﬁnancial condition.
New technology trends, such as AI and cyber resiliency and security requirements, require us and our customers to keep pace with evolving regulations and industrystandards. In the U.S., the EU, and China, there are various current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to cybersecurity and the use of AI in products and services. Weexpect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and impact both us and our customers. These changescould impact our internal use of AI and development of products that use AI, and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, allof which may have a material adverse eﬀect on our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to stringent environmental, climate change and other regulations, which may force us to incur signiﬁcant expenses and impact our operations.
We must comply with federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, emissions, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances used inour products and manufacturing processes, or that are the result of our manufacturing operations, such as greenhouse gases. We must also comply with rules and regulationsregarding limiting greenhouse gas emissions, public reporting of environmental metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions and hazardous substances, and obtain third-partyassurance of greenhouse gas reporting. Regulations could require us to change manufacturing processes, substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, obtainnew permits and undertake other costly activities.
Our failure to comply, or the failure of entities that we have acquired over time to have complied, with regulations could result in signiﬁcant ﬁnes, litigation or administrativeactions by regulators or others, liability for clean-up, criminal and civil liabilities, import/export restrictions, reduction or suspension of production, cessation of operations orfuture liabilities. Restrictions on emissions could result in signiﬁcant costs such as the need for additional equipment, higher energy costs, carbon taxes, and emission cap andtrade programs, and could also result in reduction or suspension of production, or even cessation of operations. Such regulations have required us in the past, and could requireus in the future, to incur signiﬁcant expenses to comply with such regulations. Our failure to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances couldnot only impact the health of our employees, customers and communities in which we operate, but could also impact our ability to operate. Such failure could also restrict ourability to ship certain products to certain countries, require us to modify our products, shipping materials or logistics, or require us to incur other signiﬁcant costs and expenses.Environmental laws continue to expand with a focus on reducing or eliminating hazardous substances in electronic products and shipping materials. Future environmentalregulations could require us to close or reduce production at certain facilities, reengineer certain of our existing products and may prevent us or make it more expensive for us tomanufacture, sell and ship our products. Regulations restricting greenhouse gas emissions could cause us to incur signiﬁcant additional costs of compliance due to the need forchanges in manufacturing methods or installation of abatement equipment, expanded data collection, analysis, and certiﬁcation. For example, in Colorado, Regulation 27 requirescompanies operating in Colorado to signiﬁcantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a short timeframe. Because we have contractual obligations to certain customers to assessthe impact that manufacturing process changes may have on the products that we provide to such customers, we have to take a measured approach when implementing changesto our facilities, manufacturing processes, and manufacturing inputs. If we are unable to implement the necessary abatement plan, we may be required to ramp down our existingoperations signiﬁcantly or risk noncompliance with the rule. The magnitude of the penalties that may be imposed for non-compliance is not currently known but could includesigniﬁcant monetary penalties and orders to reduce or cease production.
The number and complexity of laws and customer requirements focused on the energy eﬃciency of electronic products, the recycling of electronic products, the reduction ofchemicals used in and to manufacture electronic products, and the reduction in the amount of packing materials and the increase in the required recycling of packing materialshave expanded signiﬁcantly. It may be diﬃcult for us to timely comply with these laws and we may have insuﬃcient quantities of compliant products to meet customers' needs,thereby adversely impacting our sales and proﬁtability. We may have to write oﬀ

inventory if we hold unsaleable inventory as a result of changes to regulations. We expect these risks to continue. These requirements may increase our own costs, as well asthose passed on to us by our supply chain.
Sustained adverse climate change poses risks that could harm our results of operations.
Sustained adverse changes in climate could have a direct adverse economic impact on us due to the eﬀects of extreme weather and climate events on our productionfacilities, our supply chain and customers. Utility shortages, higher costs of utilities, and reduced availability of water could disrupt our operations as well as those of ourcustomers and suppliers. Certain of our operations are located in arid or tropical regions, which some experts believe may become vulnerable to more frequent ﬁres, storms,severe ﬂoods and droughts. While our business recovery plans are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other disruptive events, our plans may not protect usfrom all events.
Voluntary actions we may take or have taken as part of our ESG initiatives could require us to limit emissions, change manufacturing processes, substitute materials whichmay cost more or be less available, fund oﬀset projects, or undertake other costly activities. Voluntary restrictions on emissions could result in signiﬁcant costs such as the needfor additional equipment, higher energy costs, carbon taxes, and emission cap and trade programs. The cost of compliance with such voluntary eﬀorts could restrict ourmanufacturing operations, increase our costs, and have an adverse eﬀect on our operating results. Customer demands and regulations related to conﬂict-free minerals and other substances incorporated into or used to manufacture our products may force us to incuradditional expenses.
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, in August 2012, the SEC released investigation, and disclosure requirements regarding the use of"conﬂict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We have ﬁled a Form SD with the SEC regarding such matters annually since June 2,2014. Other countries are considering similar regulations. If we cannot certify that our supply chain is free from the risk of irresponsible sourcing, customers and others maydemand that we change the sourcing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, even if the costs for compliant materials signiﬁcantly increases or availability islimited.  If we change materials or suppliers, there will likely be costs associated with qualifying new suppliers and production capacity, delivery times and quality could benegatively impacted.  Our relationships with customers, suppliers and stockholders may be adversely aﬀected if we are unable to certify that our products are free from the risk ofirresponsible sourcing. We have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, such as costs related todetermining the source of any conﬂict minerals used in our products.  We may be unable to satisfy those that require that all of the components of our products be certiﬁed asconﬂict free in a materially diﬀerent manner than advocated by the Responsible Minerals Initiative or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  If we areunable to meet customer requirements, customers may disqualify us as a supplier, resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer or a reduction inpurchases from us, and we may have to write oﬀ inventory if it cannot be sold.
In addition to concerns over “conﬂict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo, our customers may require that other minerals and substances used withinour supply chain, manufacturing processes, or contained in our products be evaluated and reported on. An increase in reporting obligations will increase associated operatingcosts. This could have negative eﬀects on our overall operating proﬁts.
Failure to meet ESG expectations, standards or disclosure requirements or achieve our corporate responsibility goals, could adversely aﬀect our business, results ofoperations, ﬁnancial condition, or stock price.
In recent years, there has been an increased focus on corporate responsibility matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, waterstewardship, waste management, data privacy, cybersecurity, trade controls, responsible sourcing and supply chain, use of products for illegal or unethical purposes, human rights,and social responsibility. We are committed to corporate responsibility and actively manage these issues in accordance with applicable law and including through our guidingvalues and our internal policies. As an example, since we do not support the actions of Russia against Ukraine, in March 2022 we stopped selling products to customers anddistributors located in Russia and Belarus. However, we have been made aware that there are entities in Russia that indirectly obtained our products after March 2022 despite thepreventative measures we took and continue to take. Though we continue to improve our processes and procedures to prevent the unauthorized ﬂow of our products, our actionshave not been fully successful. We operate in an extensive, ever-changing global supply chain, an expectation of complete traceability of standard semiconductor products toevery end use and prevention of product misuse and diversion is unachievable. Thus, despite our eﬀorts, our products may be used for illegal or objectionable applications andthird parties may engage in conduct that we do not support or condone.

usage, however, we may reﬁne or modify such goals in the future. These goals reﬂect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achievethem. These goals could expose us to heightened scrutiny and ﬁnancial, legal, reputational, operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, whichcould negatively impact us. Further, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations could also negatively impactus.
In addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, including, for example, the state ofCalifornia's new climate change disclosure requirements and the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as theoverall increased focus and scrutiny from certain regulators, investors, customers, vendors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could imposeadditional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in changes to our current ESG goals.
Evolving stakeholder expectations, voluntary and required reporting regimes that are not harmonized and continue to change, and our eﬀorts to manage these issues, reporton them, and accomplish our goals, present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, ﬁnancial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact,including on our reputation and stock price. It is also possible that government, customers, investors and other stakeholders might not be satisﬁed with our policies, programs,goals, performance and related disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success, or that we have adopted such policies, programs andcommitments.
Such risks and uncertainties include:
• reputational harm, including damage to our relationship with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders;• some customers may choose not to do business with us, or we may choose to discontinue or restrict business with certain customers due to our policies;
• liabilities or penalties associated with inadequate processes to collect, audit, or disclose information;• adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products;• increased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action;• unfavorable ESG ratings or investor sentiment;• diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on ESG metrics;• our ability to achieve our goals within announced timeframes;• increased costs and resources to monitor, report and achieve our goals;• unforeseen operational and technological diﬃculties;• access to and increased cost of capital; and• adverse impacts on our stock price.
Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations or industry standards, or achieve our corporate responsibility goals could have an adverse eﬀecton our business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition, reputation, or stock price.
Risks Related to Capitalization and Financial Markets
The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide ﬂuctuations in response to a variety of factors.
The market price of our common stock has ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly in the recent past and is likely to ﬂuctuate in the future. The future trading price of our common stockcould be subject to wide ﬂuctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:
• global economic and ﬁnancial uncertainty due to changes in tariﬀs, interest rates, persistent inﬂation, instability in the banking sector, war or other conﬂicts, publichealth concerns or other factors;• political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;• quarterly variations in our operating results, ﬁnancial condition, including our liquidity, or the operating results of other technology companies;• changes in our ﬁnancial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance;• changes in analysts' estimates of our ﬁnancial performance or buy/sell recommendations;

• general conditions in the semiconductor industry;• the amount and timing of repurchases of shares of our common stock;• our ability to realize the expected beneﬁts of our completed or future acquisitions;• announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations; and• actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new products by us or our competitors.
In addition, the stock market has recently and in the past experienced signiﬁcant price and volume ﬂuctuations that have aﬀected the market prices for many companies andthat often have been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market ﬂuctuations and other factors have harmed and may harm the market price of our commonstock. The foregoing factors could also cause the market price of our Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares to decline or ﬂuctuate substantially. In thepast, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the target of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, wecould incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an adverse impact on our ﬁnancial performance and the price of our commonstock or Series A Preferred Stock.
The amount and timing of our share repurchases may ﬂuctuate in response to a variety of factors.
The amount, timing, and execution of repurchases of shares of our common stock may ﬂuctuate based on the share price of our common stock, general business and marketconditions, tax regulations impacting share repurchases and other factors including our operating results, level of cash ﬂow, leverage ratios, capital expenditures and dividendpayments on our common stock and preferred stock. Although our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $4.00 billion, of which $1.56 billion is stillavailable, the authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fullyconsummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The repurchase authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and may aﬀectthe trading price of our common stock and increase volatility. We did not repurchase any shares in the September 2025 quarter.
Our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we do not eﬀectively manage or reﬁnance our current or future debt.
As of September 30, 2025, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $5.41 billion. At September 30, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under ourRevolving Credit Facility which provides $2.25 billion of revolving loan commitments that terminate in 2030 and $1.12 billion outstanding principal amounts under our CommercialPaper program. At September 30, 2025, we had $3.00 billion in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and $1.29 billion in aggregate principal of Convertible Debtoutstanding. We intend to ﬁnance the repayment of our ﬁxed rate debt maturing within the next 12 months using available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, ourCommercial Paper program or other instruments at which point, changes in interest rates will have a more signiﬁcant impact on our interest expense if we reﬁnance such ﬁxedrate debt with variable rate debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reﬁnance our current or future debt on reasonable terms, if at all.
Servicing our debt requires a signiﬁcant amount of cash, we may not have suﬃcient cash to fund payments and adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase ourborrowing costs and adversely aﬀect our ability to access the debt markets.
Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal, interest, or to reﬁnance our indebtedness, including our outstanding Senior Notes, Convertible Debt, and CommercialPaper, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, competitive and other factors. Our business may not continue to generate suﬃcient cash ﬂow to serviceour debt and to fund capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases or acquisitions. If we are unable to generate such cash ﬂow, we may be required to undertakealternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on onerous or highly dilutive terms. In several recent quarters, we have usedborrowings to ﬁnance a portion of our quarterly dividend payments and we may continue to do so in future periods. Our ability to reﬁnance our indebtedness will depend on thecapital markets and our ﬁnancial condition at such time. Our Senior Notes and Commercial Paper are rated by certain major credit rating agencies. These credit ratings impact ourcost of borrowing and our ability to access the capital markets and are based on our ﬁnancial performance and ﬁnancial metrics including debt levels. While we have maintainedour investment grade rating, we were recently downgraded by one rating agency and there is no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of ourcredit rating by a major credit rating agency could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely aﬀect our ability to access the debt markets to reﬁnance our existingdebt or ﬁnance future debt. Our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely aﬀect our ability to take advantage of opportunities and could adversely aﬀect ourﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

Conversion of our Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, or the payment of dividends on Series A Preferred Stock in shares of common stock, willdilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.
The conversion of some or all of our shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the form of commonstock or the conversion of our outstanding Convertible Debt will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversionof such debt. Following our irrevocable settlement election made on April 1, 2022, upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to suchconverted Convertible Debt by delivering cash equal to the principal amount of such converted Convertible Debt and cash and shares of common stock or any combination, at ouroption, with respect to any conversion value in excess thereof (i.e., the conversion spread). There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common sharecomputation for the cash settled portion of the Convertible Debt as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread will be included inthe denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share. Any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon conversion of our ConvertibleDebt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares or the payment of dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the form of common stock could adversely aﬀect prevailingmarket prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares may encourage short selling by marketparticipants because the conversion of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares, as applicable, could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipatedconversion of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
The Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares may adversely aﬀect the market price of our common stock.
The market price of our common stock is likely to be inﬂuenced by our Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares. The market price of our commonstock could become more volatile and could be depressed by: (1) investors’ anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares ofcommon stock received upon conversion of the Convertible Debt, Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares; (2) possible sales of our common stock by investors who view theSeries A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of common stock; and (3) hedging or arbitrage tradingactivity that we expect to develop involving the Series A Preferred Stock or Depositary Shares and our common stock.
Our common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution.
Our common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, winding-up ordissolution. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock through the most recentlycompleted dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntaryliquidation, winding-up or dissolution, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock aliquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our operating results.
We use forward currency exchange contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the eﬀect of exchange rate ﬂuctuations on our non-U.S. dollar netbalance sheet exposures. Nevertheless, in periods when the U.S. dollar signiﬁcantly ﬂuctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business, the value of ournon-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse eﬀect on our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. In particular, in periods when the value of a non-U.S. currencysigniﬁcantly declines relative to the U.S. dollar, customers transacting in that currency may be unable to fulﬁll their contractual obligations or to undertake new obligations tomake payments or purchase products. In periods when the U.S. dollar declines signiﬁcantly relative to the British pound, Euro, Thai baht and Taiwan dollar, the operational costs inour European and Thailand subsidiaries are adversely aﬀected. Although our business has not been materially adversely impacted by recent changes in the value of the U.S. dollar,there can be no assurance as to the future impact that any weakness or strength in the U.S. dollar will have on our business or results of operations.
