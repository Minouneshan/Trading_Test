Valuation and market reference (Semiconductor List.xlsx, Nov 2025)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Ticker QCOM; share price ~$174.50; market cap ~$187B; beta 1.10; dividend yield 2.04%; net profit margin (LTM) 29.2%; debt-to-equity 69.8%.
- Revenue LTM $44.14B; FY2025 consensus (current FY1) $45.6B (+3.2% YoY) and FY2026 $46.1B (+1.3%); implied NTM price-to-sales 4.10x.
- EPS LTM $12.03, FY2025 consensus $12.12, FY2026 $12.43; NTM P/E ~14.3x with PEG (FY1) ~0.45x on low growth plus resilient margins.
- Semi peer context: QCOM trades at a discount to high-growth AI CPU/GPU names (AMD 14x sales, NVDA 20x) but aligns with high-quality analog/mixed-signal leaders; 90-day annualized vol sub-30% keeps it a defensive wireless/edge AI play.
