- Net revenue $53.1B (vs. $54.2B in FY2023, -2%); gross margin $17.3B (32.7%); operating loss -$11.7B; net loss -$19.2B as IDM 2.0 modernization charges and inventory reserves hit P&L.
- Operating expenses $29.0B (+$7.4B YoY) including $3.5B restructuring, $7.0B product cost adjustments, and $2.2B depreciation tied to factory start-up.
- Operating cash flow $8.3B; capex (additions to property, plant & equipment) $23.9B; free cash flow roughly -$15.6B reflecting aggressive foundry build-out (Ohio, Arizona, Germany, D1X).
- Cash & cash equivalents $8.2B plus $13.8B short-term investments = $22.0B liquidity; total current assets $47.3B vs. current liabilities $35.7B (1.3x current ratio).

- Short-term debt $3.7B; total debt $46.3B; Intel stockholders' equity $99.3B (down $6.3B YoY) as accumulated deficit absorbs restructuring.

Segment detail FY2024
---------------------
- Client Computing Group (CCG): revenue $30.3B (+3.5%); gross margin $15.7B; AI PC enablement and Windows refresh offset a weaker low-end notebook market.
- Data Center & AI (DCAI): revenue $12.8B (+1.4%); gross margin $6.0B; Gaudi 2/3 inference cards and Granite Rapids sampling partially offset Sapphire Rapids pricing pressure.
- Network & Edge (NEX): revenue $5.8B (+1.2%); gross margin $3.4B; demand muted as telco digestion continued but industrial Ethernet stabilized.
- Intel Foundry (IFS + manufacturing services): revenue $17.5B (-7.2%); gross margin -$8.1B; operating loss -$13.4B as utilization on 18A/20A ramps and external wafer mix (Tower/MediaTek) remains sub-scale.
- Total Intel Products (CCG + DCAI + NEX) delivered $48.9B revenue (92% of consolidated); $25.1B gross margin; $13.2B operating income, which is entirely consumed by IFS drag and corporate allocations.

Cash flow, balance sheet, capital allocation
-------------------------------------------
- Operating cash flow $8.3B; investing cash flow -$18.3B (capex-heavy, partially offset by $5.7B CHIPS prepayments & reimbursement accruals); financing cash flow +$11.1B driven by debt issuance and government incentives.
- Cash ending balance $8.2B vs. $7.1B prior year; short-term investments stepped down $3.1B to fund fab spend and Mobileye stake increase.
- Working capital stretched: inventories $12.2B as Intel stages EUV nodes; accounts payable $12.6B reflecting tool deliveries; accrued comp at $4.0B after restructuring.
- Foundry subsidies (U.S. CHIPS + EU/German packages) approved but cash receipts largely 2025+; Intel expects $10B+ combined to offset capex.
