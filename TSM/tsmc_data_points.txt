- Top 10 customers accounted for ~76% of 2024 net revenue (vs. 70% in 2023 and 68% in 2022).
- Largest customer represented 22% of net revenue (25% in 2023); second-largest 12% (11% in 2023).
- Wafer fabrication contributed ~87% of total net revenue; remainder from testing, packaging, mask making, design, and royalty income.

Capex, capacity expansion, and subsidies (Form 20-F Item 4 plus CHIPS/JASM/ESMC disclosures):
- TSMC Arizona Corporation signed U.S. CHIPS Act agreements (Nov 2024) for up to US$6.6B direct funding + up to US$5B federal loans covering three fabs (N4/N5, N3/N2, future A14/A10-class).
- European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC, Dresden) secured up to EUR5B of state aid under the European Chips Act (Dec 2024) to build a 300mm fab (28/22/16/12nm) with Bosch/Infineon/NXP.
- Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) Phase 1 (22/28nm) backed by up to JPY476B subsidy; Phase 2 adds 12/16nm and 6/5nm capacity by 2027 with Toyota joining consortium.
- 2024 capex spent on: N3/N3E ramp, N2 development, backend capacity (CoWoS/SoIC), new fabs in Arizona/Japan/Germany.

Advanced packaging and technology roadmap (Form 20-F Item 4):
- CoWoS output targeted to more than double from 2023 to 2026; SoIC (3D stacking) positioned for AI/HPC demand with backside power delivery planned for N2/N2P.
- Process status: 3nm in high-volume production; 2nm entering risk production in 2024 with volume in 2025; 1.4nm-class nodes under development.

Risk factors (Form 20-F Item 3.D excerpts referenced in brief):
- Dependency on cyclical semiconductor demand; high fixed-cost fabs increase leverage to utilization swings.
- Concentrated customer base; large customers pursuing dual-sourcing and internal silicon designs.
- Geopolitical and regulatory exposure (Taiwan-centric footprint, export controls, subsidy guardrails restricting expansion in countries of concern).
- Supply chain and talent challenges for overseas fabs; potential subsidy clawbacks if milestones missed.
- IT/cybersecurity threats as global footprint expands.

Scenario framework (based on management commentary + peer consensus in Semiconductor List.xlsx):
- Bear: FY2025 revenue ~US$80B if AI demand pauses and N3 ramps slip; EPS ~NT$32, utilization mid-70%.
- Base: FY2025 revenue ~US$92B with sustained HPC strength, smartphones mid-single-digit growth, stable automotive; EPS ~NT$38.
- Bull: FY2025 revenue ~US$100B driven by third-wave AI accelerators, accelerated N2 commercialization, automotive doubling; EPS ~NT$43.

Conversion and methodology notes:
- USD figures use Note 3 average exchange rate (NT$32.79 = US$1) provided in the Form 20-F.
- Free cash flow definition matches Form 20-F: operating cash flow minus capital expenditures (property, plant, and equipment).
- Mix percentages reflect revenue recognized by customer headquarters or platform classifications and may differ from shipment destinations.
